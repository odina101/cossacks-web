June 27th, 1709
The Swedish army of 25,000 soldiers led by Charles XII invaded Ukraine. Ukrainian Hetman Mazepa supported the Russian Tsar but soon went over to the Swedish side. The Swedish army posed a serious threat to the south of Russia, so Peter I decided to drive the Swedes from their conquered territories. His army of 40,000 soldiers was superior in numbers, but this advantage was partially compensated for by the Swedish forces' excellent training. The Swedes were decidedly the best in western Europe concerning discipline, training, valour and experience. The decisive battle took place near Poltava, where Swedish forces attacked the Russians but failed to overcome their resistance. The Russian cavalry began to outflank the Swedes from both sides, and soon the entire army initiated a counterattack. The Russian forces achieved a valiant victory that greatly influenced the course of the whole war, though military operations continued until 1721.
