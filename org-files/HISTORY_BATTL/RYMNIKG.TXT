The objective of the allied forces (red), having destroyed the feeble Turkish camp (blue) in zone 1 and captured their banner, is to crush the rest of the enemy forces. The Turks lose if their "Command Centre" in zone 3 is lost. 
The blue player must destroy as many allies as possible at the first camp and not let the headquarters be destroyed in the second.     
The banner can be captured if the "Command Centre" in zone 1 is destroyed and the area surrounding its location is captured.  

Turkish observation posts are located in zones 1, 2, 3 and 4. If an enemy is spotted, the alarm is sounded and the camp's troops pass under the command of the blue player. In camp 1 there are scouts who, on seeing an enemy, can also raise the alarm, provided the enemy is within the observation post's line of sight. 

The red player has unique units - standard bearers. Units have their attack values increased within a close radius around a standard bearer. After capturing the Turkish banner, all the standard bearers have their attack bonus increased.   

Crossings are located in X zones.
