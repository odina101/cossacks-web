September 17th, 1631
A year and three months had passed since Gustaf Adolf had disembarked on the Pomeranian shore, and still no decisive battle had taken place. The Swedish and Saxon armies numbered about 39,000 soldiers and 75 cannon, while the forces of the Emperor and the League comprised only 36,000 soldiers and 26 cannon. Nevertheless, Tilly counted on Gustaf Adolf's numerical superiority being counterbalanced by the quality of his troops. 16,000 raw Saxon recruits were no match for his own well-trained forces. Marching out from the city of Leipzig, Tilly positioned his army on an eminence on the plain to the right of the village of Breitenfeld, 2 km (1.2 miles) from the Loberbach stream. The Swedish army crossed the stream and attacked, while Tilly watched and did nothing. As a result, the fierce battle ended with the defeat of the Imperial forces. Seriously wounded, Tilly barely escaped death and retreated to Halle. His captured infantry went over to the Swedish side, making the Swedish army stronger after the battle than it had been beforehand.
