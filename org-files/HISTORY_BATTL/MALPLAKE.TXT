September 11th, 1709
Malplaquet was the last great battle of the War of the Spanish Succession. Since the city of Lille had been lost, France was so exhausted that Louis XIV was on the verge of abandoning not only the goal of the war (i.e. securing the Spanish throne for his own grandson), but even his grip on Alsace. But his allies appealed to his sense of honour and persuaded him to continue his struggle. The army's strategic goal was to continue the defensive. In command of the French army, Marshall Villars reached a position near the village of Malplaquet that was so close to Mons fortress, which was besieged by the allied English and Austrian army, that the latter had to drive Villars from the village before they could go on with the siege. The position was hastily reinforced. The French army comprised 95,000 soldiers and opposed 110,000 units of English and Austrian forces. A strong English and Austrian column advanced through the north-west, lost its way and took part only in the final stage of the battle. The limited forces commanded by the Prince of Orange on the southern field fiercely attacked the French fortifications. The battle resulted in 32,000 casualties on the side of the Allies and 12,000 casualties in the French army. The French forces regrouped a mile from the battlefield. Although they could not prevent the fall of Mons, they did win the battle.
