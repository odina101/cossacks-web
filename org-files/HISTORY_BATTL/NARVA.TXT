1704
As soon as Derpt had been taken, it was time to conquer Narva, and Sheremetyev positioned his army on the avenue of approach. A Swedish garrison of 2,000 soldiers with Commander Horn in charge was situated in Narva itself. A squadron of 12,000 cavalrymen led by Schlippenbach was encamped in Riga and tried to conduct raids on the Russian army's rear. However, the squadron was utterly defeated by Russian General Rene. After a violent storm on August 13th, the Russians rushed into the city from both flanks. In the height of battle, the Swedes set off a charge that caused great casualties on both sides. The Swedes fought desperately and the Russian army suffered great losses in their victorious battle at Narva.
