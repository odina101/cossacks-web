In order to win this battle, the advancing Swedish army (blue) must either capture and hold any three of the five specified positions or entirely destroy the Russian army (red). "Capture" means all enemy military forces must be cleared from the area and your soldiers must take up positions there instead.
The Russians will win if they destroy the enemy entirely or manage to hold their positions for a certain amount of time.
