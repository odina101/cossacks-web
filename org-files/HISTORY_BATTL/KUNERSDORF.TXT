August 12th, 1759
The Battle of Kunersdorf (a settlement in the province of Brandenburg) took place at a critical moment for Prussia during the Russian advance towards Berlin. The Russians stood before the gates of Frankfurt on the right bank of the Oder river. Frederick approached from the south and passed by them, then crossed the river and initiated a surrounding assault from the south-east. At first his attack seemed quite effective. However, the Russian front was strongly protected by pools and streams, so that Frederick failed to make full use of his 13,000 cavalrymen. The Russian army under the command of P. S. Saltykov fought back all attacks by the Prussian infantry and Seidlitz's cavalry and launched a counterattack. Soon the Prussian detachments were overwhelmed. The cavalry led by P. A. Rumiantsev proved especially valuable. The outcome of that battle was a disaster for Prussia. Having barely escaped captivity, Frederick was on the point of suicide. In 1760 the Russians took Berlin.
