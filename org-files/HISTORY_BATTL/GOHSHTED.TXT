August 13th, 1704
At the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, Louis XIV was so vastly superior that he could even entertain the idea of heading straight for his rivals and crushing them like Napoleon. A coalition with the Bavarian Elector presented the opportunity of leading the united army through Italy and Germany and to besiege Vienna. However, his opponents gained an advantage thanks to successful manoeuvres and because Marlborough's English and Dutch army had marched off towards the Danube. When the French and Bavarian troops took an unassailable position near Augsburg, the English had only to systematically ravage the Bavarian counties in order to force the Elector to surrender. However, the Elector turned out to be tougher than expected, and the English army could be called back at any time. Aware of this, the Duke of Marlborough decided to besiege Ingolstadt. As the French and Bavarian forces put up a strong resistance, Austrian commander-in-chief Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough decided to attack the enemy's new position before it could be secured. The French and Bavarian army was taken by surprise before the fortifications could be completed. The English and Austrian forces triumphed with an insignificant superiority of 48,000 against 47,000 French and Bavarian soldiers. Ludwig Baden's corps had been commanded to besiege Ingolstadt. Marlborough successfully breached the enemy defences in the centre. After that, the French and Bavarian forces faced the threat of being outflanked. As a result, the Blindheim garrison surrendered. The French army was led by Marshal Tallare and Marshal Marcin, while Max Emmanuel commanded the Bavarians. The English forces were led by the Duke of Marlborough (left flank and centre) and Eugene of Savoy commanded the Imperial army (right flank).
