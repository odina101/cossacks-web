November 16th, 1632
Wallenstein's army invaded Saxony and took Leipzig by force. In an attempt to liberate the town, Gustaf Adolf led his troops out of southern Germany. Pappenheim arrived to reinforce Wallenstein's army, while Gustaf Adolf took up such a strong position on the Saale River to the north of Naumburg that Wallenstein did not dare to attack, despite his numerical superiority. For several days the armies stood facing each other and suffered the terrible November weather. Finally, Wallenstein decided to withdraw his troops to winter quarters in Saxon cities. When Gustaf Adolf learned of this, he attacked immediately, hoping to crush the Imperials before they were able to regroup. Wallenstein commanded mobile forces to hold the Swedes back while organizing a defensive near Luetzen. The city was surrounded by impassable flooded plains and swamps and was considered inaccessible. Gustaf Adolf commanded 16,300 troops, including 5,100 riders and 60 cannon. Wallenstein opposed him with 12,000 troops comprising 4,000 riders and 21 cannon. Their numerical and qualitative superiority helped the Swedish army to victory.
