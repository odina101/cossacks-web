December 5th, 1757
In this battle, the Austrian forces had a great numerical superiority (60,000 against 40,000 Prussians), but their slow defensive strategy played a lethal trick on them. Instead of taking advantage of their superiority and conducting operations in winter, they packed up and moved to winter quarters. As the enemy approached, they thought it was sufficient simply to block his way and take up a defensive position. They did not seem to realise that the enemy might attack! Frederick's forces managed to go completely unnoticed as they outflanked the Austrian army. Then the Prussians attacked and crushed the enemy's left wing before the right one approached the battlefield.
