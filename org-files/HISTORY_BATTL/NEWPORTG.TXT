The objective of the Spanish army (red) is to raise the blockade of Newport by capturing three out of five zones controlled by the Dutch (blue).  
The Dutch win if they capture the fort. Newport is considered captured if there are no enemy units left inside it. 

The Spanish Croats have been much strengthened. 
The troops of Newport pass under the command of a player if at least one red unit is in zone X.
