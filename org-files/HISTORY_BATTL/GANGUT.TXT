July 27th, 1714
In July 1714, Russian forces marched through the south of Finland. City upon city surrendered to the victorious army. The Swedes distinctively felt the impending threat. The Russians strove to reach the Gulf of Bothnia and to that end, 15,000 soldiers embarked 99 galleys and semi-galleys and advanced to the Abo (Turku) fortress. Swedish troops tried to hold them back and sent out a squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Niels Ehrenscheld. (The squadron comprised 10 vessels - the flagship "Elephant", the boats "Flundra", "Mortan" and "Simpan", the galleys "Ern", "Trana", "Grippen", "Laksen", "Gedeen" and "Valfisch" - with a total crew of 941.) They believed Tsar Peter was dragging his ships by land and were instructed to hold back and destroy the Russian fleet. Peter I seized the opportunity that this calm offered and attacked the enemy. The Swedish vessels could not manoeuvre effectively and were all boarded and captured.
