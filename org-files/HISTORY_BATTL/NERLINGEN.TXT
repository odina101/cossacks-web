August 27th, 1634
After Wallenstein's murder in 1634, King Ferdinand's army under the command of General Hallas successfully captured Donauwoerth and besieged the city of Noerdlingen. The Swedes could not allow Catholics to take such an important Protestant city. They waited for reinforcements at a camp near Bopfingen - 10 kilometres (6 miles) from Noerdlingen - and then decided to approach the enemy and take up their positions on the road between Ulm and Noerdlingen. This manoeuvre allowed the Swedes to amass supplies and left the Imperial army no such opportunity. However, while the Swedish army was passing through a narrow gorge and a forest, the Imperial forces succeeded in capturing one of the positions that the Swedes had been counting on occupying: the Albuch mountain. The battle lasted until late at night. At daybreak, Horn did his best to take Albuch by force, but the Swedes' valour triumphed over the enemy's numerical superiority. Field Marshal Horn became certain that he could not capture the eminence and decided to retreat under cover of his cavalry. However, the Imperials now took the offensive. The Protestant army was disorganised, its infantry was all but exterminated, and Commander Horn was taken prisoner.
