17th century England was a place of violence and power struggle. Oppressive landlords, hunger, disese, wars, religious persecution and other perils, as well as thirst for riches, have turned the attention of many men towards the New World of Americas discovered in the west in 1492. States and privateers alike enagaged in exploration, exploitation, colonisation and war over these new lands, seeking fortune in this new, exotic world.
You will play the role of an experienced former general of the English army. You will however, not carry the banner of Britain, but your very own. Will loyal men, a good ship, and your combat experience be enough to forge a new homeland of your dreams as you burn all the bridges behind you and leave England?
