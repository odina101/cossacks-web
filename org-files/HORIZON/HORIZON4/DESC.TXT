Autumn, 1661
More than a year has passed. Despite constant attacks and undermining from the king, the Independent State of Laretia grew into a small but prosperous island-country and established trade with the French and Spanish colonies. Some British colonies engaged in trade too, despite the fact that the king declared Laretia to be a rebel settlement.
However, our agents have confirmed that England has concluded a temporary alliance with Spain in order to destroy us. The Spanish colonial army is now assembling in South America and slowly marching towards Cartagena where they will board transports to attack us. We have come up with a plan to quickly disembark our troops near Cartagena and intercept the enemy army. It's risky to commit almost our entire army here, but if we succeed, the suprise element will be enough to crush the enemy before they reach their fleet.
