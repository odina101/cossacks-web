Summer, 1662
Many people have joined our cause over the years, escaping form various brutalities in Europe. Our island is now inhabited by many former British, Spanish, French and other citizens.
This year France, an old enemy of Britain, has concluded an alliance with us. They report that the king of England has dispatched a large army and fleet under the command of Baron Alan Kenneth to defeat us. This may be the biggest battle for our island yet. France has promised reinforcements, but it is unknown when they will arrive.
We should fortify our position and defend our homes until they arrive. We will not allow usurpers to ruin our prosperous state.
