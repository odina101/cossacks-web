You will win if you survive the enemy siege!
You will lose if your central Town Hall is captured or destroyed!

Laretia is under heavy attack. You cannot hope to stop the enemy alone this time. You should hold your position until reinforcements arrive.

#P1 Missions\Pictures\mord_d 1
Do not let the enemy destroy or capture the Town Hall in the city square. Our command staff, supplies, and refugees are in it!

#P2 Missions\Pictures\mord2_tut 2
This is only the first wave to test our defences. Scouts report at least a thousand more enemies approaching the shore on transports!

Another wave defeated. Elite enemy units are now approaching the island. Let's hope the reinforcements arrive in time.

Reinforcements have arrived! French forces along with some of our outlying forces have disembarked on the other side of the island and made their way here on foot. A French heavy cruiser has also arrived to the south!
Drive the enemy forces off the island! Destory their Command Centre on the eastern island!

Keep an eye on the gold supply. We will need gold to operate our ships and take out the enemy headquarters.

#P5 Missions\Pictures\mord_d 1
You've lost your main Town Hall!

#P6 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 13
Enemy headquarters have been demolished! The rest of the King's forces are in retreat.
We have won a major victory today and showed the world the strength of our independent state thanks to your outstanding commanding skills!
