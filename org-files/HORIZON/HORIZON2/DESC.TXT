Summer, 1660
England is far behind you. You arrive at the Carribean Sea in summer. The journey has cost you though. You are down to only two ships and your supplies are dangerously low. You will need to resupply and strengthen your fleet before you move on and look for a place that will be your new home.
Word is that you have made many enemies back in Britain, and beyond. Baron Kenneth and the king took your escape as a personal insult and will surely not make your travels easier.
