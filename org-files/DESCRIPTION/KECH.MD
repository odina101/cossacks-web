A new type of ship designed to shell coastline fortifications and seaside settlements from the sea was developed in the 18th century. Such vessels were equipped with only two masts: a mainmast with upright sails and a mizenmast with fore and aft sails. In place of the foremast, this ship possessed a platform on which one or two powerful mortars were set. The fire of these ships could deliver substantial damage to fortification walls, they were indispensable in large-scale landing operations.
