The Venetians were among the trendsetters when it came to building and using rowing vessels. Their fleet included numerous galleys and one of the most powerful and expensive rowing vessels: the galleass. A galleass was larger than a galley. It could be up to 70 metres in length, and its crew numbered up to 1200 sailors. The baptism of fire for the galleass took place in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, and brought about the victory of the Christians over the Ottoman fleet. Galleasses made use of their advantage over other types of vessels under calm, when their oars allowed them to gain quite a good speed. However, their navigability left much to be desired, and they were incapable of manoeuvring in a storm. Therefore, they did not put to sea under bad weather conditions.
