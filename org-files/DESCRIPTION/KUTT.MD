A cutter was mainly used for patrols and possessed a fairly good speed and seagoing abilities. It was a single masted mast ship with quite an advanced rig. On the upper deck were about 18 to 20 guns or carronades. Its characteristics will enable the cutter to outrun any yacht and it will logically take over from this class of warships. Player will be unable to use it in major battles for domination at sea, but it is well suited to control vast sea communications and destroy obsolete (17th century) enemy ships.
