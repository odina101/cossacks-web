1661 
We have entered into an alliance with England. It's time to restore the former might of our state and retake our captured colonies. First of all, we are talking about Brazil. Using the support of the English fleet, your group will go ashore on the coast and build a fort for our new colony. Then you will build a shipyard and an appropriate infrastructure and settlements to supply the troops. Then, as soon as you have enough troops, drive the Dutch from the lands God has granted us.
