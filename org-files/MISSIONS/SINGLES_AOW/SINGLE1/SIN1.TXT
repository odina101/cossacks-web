1689, Crimea

The Russians have moved their troops against us. The army under the command of Prince Golitsyn has started off for Crimea. Your task is to repel the attack. The Russian army is badly organised and we hope you will be able to cope with it without much effort. The Tatars who live there will provide significant help in this campaign.
