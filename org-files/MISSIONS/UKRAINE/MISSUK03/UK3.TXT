Polish tycoons owning Ukrainian lands are exploiting the people. They have not only raised taxes excessively, but are also determined to eliminate unregistered Cossacks that may hinder them in achieving their goals. The Cossacks under the lead of Cossack Pavliuk have taken up arms against their Polish oppressors. The rebels have overwhelmed the provinces of Kiev, Poltava and Chernihiv. An army of 14,000 led by Hetman Potocky has advanced to suppress the revolt. This force will scorch the earth of Ukraine. Your duty is to protect your people from the invasion. You will never annihilate Hetman Potocky's army, but you can save some peasants and rebuff the usurpers.
