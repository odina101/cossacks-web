You proved your worth in the last battle and demonstrated the Cossacks' strength to Poland. The Polish King now wishes to employ you, which gives you a chance to earn money that will be useful in future, to get new weapons and recruit more soldiers. The territorial dispute between Russia and Rzeczpospolita is age-old. Poland has initiated an assault against their neighbour and besieged Smolensk. King Wladislaw IV appreciates the Cossacks and asks them to join the campaign against Russia. He charges you with forming a squad and backing the Polish forces in their march against Moscow. He promises generous gifts for you and your warriors for your assistance in this war.
