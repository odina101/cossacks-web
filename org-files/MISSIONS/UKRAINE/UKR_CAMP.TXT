Independence War

Free and endless Ukrainian steppes... Yellow and orange wheat fields and bright blue sky above... Nothing seemed to disturb the calm life of industrious people inhabiting these lands. But disasters befell one after another. At first, Polish gentry intruded into these territories to subdue the Ukrainian people and turn them into slaves. Poles considered their military power was enough to enjoy complete domination here. The people rose in arms against oppressors. Polish gentry possessed a good smell of powder and well-supplied army, while the Ukrainian people had only its desire to be free. Only a blade of a hero could obtain justice, protect the oppressed, and teach the greedy and vain enslavers a lesson.
At the Lublin Seym of 1569, Poland and Lithuanian Principality concluded a treaty of alliance. The new state of Rzecpospolita arose. Ukraine was passed into the hands of the Polish King. Ukrainian people fell under oppression, exorbitant taxes and requisitions; land was possessed by Polish feudal lords. In 1596 Lublin political union was supplemented with a religious one in order to make Orthodox Church subordinate to the Catholic one. Orthodox peasants of Ukraine were persecuted for their faith. Some of them attempted to flee from their lords. Dnieper steppes attracted the oppressed people - they could live there freely, devoting themselves to hunting, fishing, or beekeeping. Steppe living was called cossaking. They who lived in steppe should have been able to defend themselves. Cossacks built wooden fortifications - camps, or siches. They always carried weapons and wielded them well.
