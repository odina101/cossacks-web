1647
Future Hetman Bohdan Khmelnitskiy was a sotnik (lieutenant) in Chihirin. When Khmelnitskiy was away, Polish lord Czaplinsky fell upon his farm, abducted his wife and killed his son. Nobleman Khmelnitskiy went to the royal court to obtain justice. However, the court did not punish Czaplinsky, but imprisoned Khmelnitskiy. He has recently escaped to lower Dniepro and now summons the Cossacks to fight against their oppressors. Khmelnitskiy has formed a small squad, which you will join. One of your vital missions is to capture the Polish fortress Kodak. The stronghold is well-guarded and surrounded by solid fortifications.
