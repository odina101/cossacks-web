1649
The progress of the Cossack army has filled the Polish King and nobles with indignation. Poland is preparing for a campaign against Ukraine. The "pospolite ruszenie" (mobilization of the gentry) has been announced. Their regular army led by Jarema Wisznewecky has advanced to Volhynia. Lithuanian forces under the command of Janus Radziwill are approaching from the north. You should try to hold back the army and save the Ukrainian people from the dreadful invasion. The faithful Orthodox people will pray for your triumph.
