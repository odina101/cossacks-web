The oppression that the Polish authorities have imposed on the Ukrainian people is unbearable. The Poles have encroached upon Cossack territories, and a rebellion against the enslavers has been stirred up in Zaporizhzhya. Bohdan Khmelnitskiy was elected Hetman of the Zaporizhzhian Sich. The Crimean Khan is now our ally in this war and has detached a squad led by Muzra Tughay-Bey to assist us. The Polish authorities have assigned an army to suppress the mutiny, so your mission is to hold it back. Veteran commanders Hetman Potocky and Hetman Kaliniwsky are in command of the enemy forces.
