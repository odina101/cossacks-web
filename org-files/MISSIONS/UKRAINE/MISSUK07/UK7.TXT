1651
Ukraine has signed a favourable treaty with Rzeczpospolita: The Cossacks control Chernihiv, Brazlaw and Kiev; all state posts are occupied by Orthodox Ukrainians; Jesuits and Jews have no right to live here. The Ukrainian state is growing stronger. It is time to start reconstructing the economy. But the Poles will not give up the rich Ukrainian soil so easily. They are gathering their forces and will launch offensives. They will probably try to recover the lost estates and punish anyone who stands up to them. Enemy aggression is expected at any moment, so you should guard the rebuilt villages. In February 1651, the Poles tried to invade Podolia and crushed our regiment led by Cossack Nechay.
