  If you crush the Polish, you will not only save many villages from demolition, but also get rid of barons that are actively trying to lead Poland into war. There are three settlements under your control. You must not lose a single one of them.

  Greetings! Our squad was escorting a delegation headed by a metropolitan to Rzecpospolita to conduct negotiations. On our way to the border, we were attacked by Poles. Many soldiers died and the metropolitan was taken prisoner. Our squad suffered great losses. Please liberate the metropolitan. We will reward you generously.
