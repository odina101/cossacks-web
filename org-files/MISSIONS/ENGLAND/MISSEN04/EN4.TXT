1659
"Sir, This year the Spanish government has officially transferred Jamaica to England. Spain acknowledges our dominance in this region. The Governor of Jamaica has promised - as a demonstration of good will - to make all necessary arrangements to prevent English privateers from plundering vessels near Spanish bases. However, the Governor privately orders you to keep the income gained by privateers at status quo."
