1667
"Dear Sir, Sir Henry Morgan has put forward the advantageous plan of landing in Cuba, Spain's wealthiest colony. The benefits of this daring raid may exceed all expectations. We further plan to capture Puerto Principe and plunder Porto Bello (both cities are in the northern part of South America). In this instance, you will act not as a representative of England, but as a private person - lest your actions should reflect badly on the English Crown. The Governor will finance your fleet construction and trusts you won't fail him."
