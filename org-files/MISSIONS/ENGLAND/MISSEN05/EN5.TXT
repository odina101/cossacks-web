1666
The Governor has decided to seize the island of Catalina, which belongs to Spain. This territory will allow you to control merchant lines in the southern regions of the Caribbean Sea. The island has a convenient bay where you can build up a base. The English Crown lacks assets to build a fleet or to transfer ships to this region, thus you should form a squadron of pirate ships and promise them a share of the loot.
