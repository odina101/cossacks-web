1671
"Sir, Your joint action with Sir Henry Morgan yielded considerable profits and scared the Spanish stiff. The Governor has assigned you to take part in the next raid against Spanish cities. Your first objective is to capture Maracaibo. It is a very rich city, and the local merchants are simply asking for somebody to empty their pockets. Numerous Spanish forces are guarding the city, but they should present no problem to a real gentleman of fortune. Remember: Again, you are acting unofficially, so take care not to leave any clues that may point to England."
