1654
"Sir, The English government's Navigation Act of 1651 not only caused the war against the Netherlands, but has also promoted piracy. Smuggling has become too profitable and numerous adventurers have joined the business, striving for easy money. They gain goods by raiding our merchant vessels. The pirate ships are full of retired privateers. The large increase in piracy is causing great anxiety among all European rulers. As our most experienced commander, you will be in charge of the expeditionary forces. Your corps will disembark at the next island. We need shipyards and a military settlement there. From that position you should launch an offensive against the Caribbean pirates."
