  The southern Bermudan island is the worst place for a military base. It is quite small and has no mineral deposits. However, you have no options - these are your orders.
#PAGE1A Missions\Pictures\england 4
  You should fortify your position here and start building your military fleet as soon as possible. Use your resources wisely - your Market is the only source of gold, coal and iron.

  A pirate schooner approaches the southern shore: "Hey you on land! Gimme all your gold or you're toast!"
