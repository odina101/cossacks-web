1655
"Sir, England has conquered Jamaica, a former Spanish outpost. Merchant lines meet there, and who holds the island controls vast stretches of the Caribbean. It allows us to guard our convoys and undermine enemy economies by destroying transports and bases. You will need a fleet. We can't send you many warships from England, so you must form squads of people prepared to serve the King for a share of the loot. The island is suitable as a privateer base. Properly organized privateers greatly benefited the English Crown in the past. Assuming the post of Deputy Governor, find a way to deprive Spain of its gold and gold mines. It's high time we gained dominance over the South American colonies."
