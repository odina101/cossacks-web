1652
In 1650 and 1651, England issued a number of laws forbidding foreigners to engage in commerce with English colonies. The laws also prohibited the import of goods to England on foreign ships. One of these laws was the so-called Navigation Act of 1651. This law undermined Dutch commerce, and the Netherlands repudiated it. War broke out between England and the Netherlands.
"Sir, It is my pleasure to announce that the Governor-General has signed the order promoting you to the rank of captain of the King's Naval Forces. You are now in charge of a squadron comprising three frigates and a transport. Your assignment is to depart from Portsmouth, advance to Bermuda, and build a base and a shipyard there. Your harbour will not only support our ships against the Dutch, but also allow you to construct new vessels to build up our strength in the Caribbean. Beware of Dutch privateers - they are capable of destroying your squadron at sea before you approach the landing point. The Governor-General is counting on your success, for our campaign depends upon it."
