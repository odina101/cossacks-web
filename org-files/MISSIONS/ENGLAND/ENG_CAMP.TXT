Caribbean Pirates

The age of great geographical discoveries proved a great stimulus for piracy and practically revived it. As soon as merchant ships loaded with American gold set sail for Europe, numerous gentlemen of fortune barred their passage. The age of Atlantic easy money lovers had begun. The Caribbean Sea became one of the most famous battlefields of pirate action; it was even called the "Filibuster Sea". England and English pirates always took an active part in wars for domination over merchant lines. He who was master of sea communications was master of the New World.
The former masters of the sea - the Spanish - confronted the English. Spain had lost its power of old under English pressure, but along with the new and ambitious state of the Netherlands striving for colony repartition it was still England's main rival in the fight for supremacy. The fate of European countries and their future prosperity were determined at sea. There were no noble battles for Europeans - piracy and warfare, trade and smuggling, feigned generosity and foul treachery - any means deemed necessary were employed to gain dominance at sea.
