  The once serene and prosperous coast of the Portuguese colonies is being attacked by French forces. The Portuguese are fighting bravely and valiantly, but the French attacks are unswerving, and city upon city has fallen to the aggressors. Practically all coastal cities are under French control. Your transport moors along the coast while the garrison of the last Portuguese city has just fallen, and the French cannon are firing point-blank at the buildings in the city.
