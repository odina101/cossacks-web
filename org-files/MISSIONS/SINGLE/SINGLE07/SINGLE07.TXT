  Dutch shipbuilders have recently learnt how to build frigates and battleships. Your assistant has just left for the Netherlands to pick up some shipbuilders for your own ship construction. On the way back, the Governor's assistant and the people on board were captured by the English and the ship was sunk. The prisoners are being held kept on the island to the north-east. You must rescue them, because this is the only way to begin constructing your navy. You will be able to build frigates and battleships, which will allow you to compete with the English fleet. The Governor's assistant and the shipbuilders must survive.
