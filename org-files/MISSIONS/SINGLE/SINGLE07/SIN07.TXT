  At the heat of the wars between England and the Netherlands, the Dutch have assaulted and successfully captured the Brazilian coast, which previously belonged to Portugal. The Portuguese cannot afford to lose such a rich colony and have formed an alliance with England in order to destroy the Dutch in Brazil. After several weeks, the English have finally landed on an island near the Brazilian cost and are now planning a major assault.
