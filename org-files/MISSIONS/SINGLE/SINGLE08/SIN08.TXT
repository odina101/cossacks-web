  During the Thirty Years' War, the Swedish forces invaded the Saxon electorate, where they enjoyed victory after victory, and they are now advancing to Dresden. The loss of such a large city could greatly weaken the Saxon army.
  Swedish forces have approached the river and gained a foothold there, and are now going to cross to the other side. The need to cross the river has put the Swedes in a disadvantageous tactical position and gives the Saxons a good chance of doing maximum damage to the enemy and possibly stopping the Swedish advance.
