Frederick entered the Seven Years' War at the height of his fame, conscious of his superiority. He had a perfectly trained army and 16 million thalers in his treasury. It is a great honour for you as a young officer to serve under his banner. The letter you have received contains valuable precepts:
	"As an officer, you must be firm when in command of your company. Soldiers should follow the orders of their officer despite any danger, for they must fear their commander more than the enemy. Should there be any sign of disobedience or cowardice, resort to the cane immediately. Corporal punishment can never be out of place. Now form your company and march to war."
