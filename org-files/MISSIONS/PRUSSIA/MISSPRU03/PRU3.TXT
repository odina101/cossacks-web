By spring 1757 three great powers - Austria, Russia and France - had formed a coalition against Prussia. Initially Frederick intended to resort to defensive warfare and give up Silesia, calling back all his troops to protect Saxony. But later, General Winterfeld's ideas led to the decision to take the initiative, and annihilate the enemies one by one, making sure not to let them unite to attack Prussia. By April, the Prussian army had invaded Bohemia and encountered main forces of the Austrian army near Prague.
