At the battle of Kunersdorf (a village in the province of Brandenburg) the Prussian army was defeated by the allied Russian and Austrian troops. This happened at a critical moment for Prussia, when Russian forces were advancing against Berlin. The Russian army under the command of P. S. Saltykov repelled the attacks of the Prussian infantry and went into an offensive, overthrowing the Prussian troops. The consequences of the defeat were extremely hard for Prussia. Frederick barely escaped captivity and was on the verge of committing suicide. In 1760, the Russian troops marched up to the gates of Berlin.
