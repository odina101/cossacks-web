1504
This year, impudent Arabian pirates have managed to trick all papal galleys. Piracy is becoming a very lucrative business in the Mediterranean sea. You have been made an offer to join this trade. Nomads rampaging in the vicinity will probably attack your town. Send them to hell. Having repelled the nomadic tribes, do not relax. The European rulers detest pirates, especially Arabian ones, and will try to demolish your settlement.
