The Spanish cannot come to terms with your increased power, and having entered into a conspiracy with the Algerian bey have delivered a stroke in response. The fortress of Penon, located on an island close to Algiers, is the Spanish stronghold. If you do not succeed in destroying it, you will not be able to control the sea and coastline. Besides, now you have another adversary - the traitorous Algerian bey who by fair means or foul will try to preserve his power. If you can cope with your enemies, you will find yourself at the summit of power. Your fame will spread throughout the whole North African coast, and every captain will find it a great honour to join you.
