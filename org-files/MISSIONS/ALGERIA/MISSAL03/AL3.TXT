1516 
The events which took place after concluding peace with Spain proved unexpected. The Algerians returned to their calls for war with Spain and requested Emir Selim to lead them. He, in turn, asked pirate Arudge for help. But Arudge had no wish to share power with Selim, so he took the city with an army of 5,000. He drowned the emir in the pool where he was taking a swim. However, the citizens did not appreciate the pirate's power and indulged in intrigues, even venturing as far as to enter into a plot with Spain. The Spanish deputy occupied Oran with an army of 100,000 soldiers and killed Arudge. The major Spanish fleet and army advanced on Algiers. Now you and your squad are to resist the assault of the Spanish king and protect the citizens of Algiers.
