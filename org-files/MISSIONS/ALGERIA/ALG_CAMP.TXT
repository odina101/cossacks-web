The Mediterranean sea was stormy in the 16th century. But it was not the wind and storms which perturbed the seafarers, but Arabian pirates - the lords of the sea who filled the waters with unfeigned horror. Their elegant xebecs conquered incautious merchants and travellers and soon caused them to regret ever having put to sea. Christian rulers could not bear such humiliation, and every so often equipped military expeditions to destroy pirate nests. But the Algerian fortresses proved too strong for them, their armies were beaten by their adversary's cunning and perseverance, as these continued to provide the eastern slave market with a never-ending supply. Following one such Algerian siege, so many soldiers were taken captives that it was hardly possible to exchange a Christian slave even for an onion.               
 You are to head a small squad of Arabian pirates and settle in a state on the African coast, which could win you the respect of the whole world and make you feared by the major European powers.
