You have been to Ukraine before, and I suspect the news of a new cossack rebellion won't surprise you. This time it is headed by the Cheheryn captain Zynoviy-Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Basically, it is all down to jealousy. Khmelnytsky's wife eloped with Chaplynsky while he was away. Chaplynsky also killed Khmelnytsky's son, who tried to prevent their flight. Khmelnytsky made up his mind to punish the miscreant and, being rejected by the King, incited the rebellion. Now the rebellion has grown into a dangerous situation. The blood of the noble Polish gentry has been shed. The King has every faith in you.
