What is a Polish knight capable of? If he is fearless, virtuous in wielding his sabre and firm in his saddle, then he may crush any enemy. And of the latter there was no shortage in 17th century Rzeczpospolita, for the Polish land was too tasty a morsel to be ignored. Hordes of greedy neighbours were poised ready to grab the biggest possible chunk of the land. Even within the state, chaos reigned. Revolts shattered Rzeczpospolita, threatening to split it into several parts unable to stand up to an external menace.
You, a knight of pure spirit and unwavering loyalty, will start your mission on your own, and put the sharpness of your blade to the test against barbarians plundering civilian towns and monasteries. Whether you will be able to assemble a powerful army, protect the lands of Rzeczpospolita and extend them at the expense of ungrateful neighbours, depends on you alone.
