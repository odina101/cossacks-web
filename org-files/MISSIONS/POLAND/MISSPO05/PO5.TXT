  The army of Rzeczpospolita has been battling near Smolensk. The expansion of Polish territory and removal of our eastern neighbour from the political arena is very important. Your troops will be transported to the north. You will have to neutralise the Russian army. The Russians are very serious adversaries and you must be well prepared before going on the offensive. First of all, you should organise supplies for your troops and build a fortified camp and an artillery depot where you can produce cannons. Once your army is prepared, go on the offensive.
