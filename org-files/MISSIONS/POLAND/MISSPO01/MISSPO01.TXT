  You approach a group of pikemen and address them, "Soldiers! Fortune smiles upon you by letting you join my army. Pledge your allegiance to me, do not keep me waiting too long!"
#PAGE1A Missions\Pictures\poland 1
  It is hardly wise to face an enemy for no reason whatsoever. But, if your highly esteemed lordship will pay us 50 pieces of gold, we shall take the oath.
#PAGE1B Missions\Pictures\poland 1
  Hail our generous master! We are ready to serve you in faith and truth!
#PAGE1C Missions\Pictures\poland 1

#PAGE3B Missions\Pictures\poland 2

#PAGE5 Missions\Pictures\poland 4
  You find loot in the bandits' camp. Your soldiers believe that part of the booty is theirs by rights. What is your reply?
#PAGE5A Missions\Pictures\poland 1
  Hurray! Hail our generous master! 
#PAGE5B Missions\Pictures\poland 1
  See here the soldiers who shed their blood, and see here their master, who steals their reward! We are returning to our village.
#PAGE5C Missions\Pictures\poland 4
  You find loot in the bandits' camp. 
#PAGE6 Missions\Pictures\poland 5
  Now who do we have here! He comes to bring us gold! Rob the man, and finish him!
#PAGE6A Missions\Pictures\poland 5
  Good sir, now here's an offer - you give us gold, and we shall serve you!
#PAGE6B Missions\Pictures\poland 5
  You are a miser! In that case, you shall die!

  I am grateful to you for saving the church, my son. If ever you need help, come to the church and I shall heal your wounds.
#PAGE8C Missions\Pictures\poland 16

#PAGE9 Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  You meet a merchant. "Noble lord! What luck to meet you here! I am going to the village ..., but there are many bandits around. Will you protect me from them?"
#PAGE9A Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  In truth, you are a noble gentleman! Let us depart immediately!
#PAGE9B Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  I am prepared to pay you 400 in gold. It is a very large sum!
#PAGE9C Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  Wait, sir! Where are you going? I shall pay you! Shall we say ... 400 in gold. That's a substantial sum of money!
#PAGE9D Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  Guards, fire! Kill the damned robber!
#PAGE9E Missions\Pictures\poland 8
  Very well then, 700. But that is my last offer. Are we agreed?

  It is signed by the King of Poland.
#PAGE16C Missions\Pictures\poland 12
  You wish to get across? I doubt there is any man who would take you to the other side right now. There are too many pirates in the gulf. The only way to get across is by capturing the pirates' transport.

 Your objective is to regain the fortress captured by the Ukrainians. Unfortunately, your squad is too small to cope with this. You can reinforce your troops in the Polish fort. Money to hire a squad can be earned by plundering camps of bandits rampaging in this area.
