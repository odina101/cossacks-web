The Czech army managed to put our valiant and victorious troops under a great deal of pressure. Do not give way to panic, our troops are not yet beaten and are not fleeing as the opponents of the catholic faith claim. They are just slightly battered and have had to fall back and regroup. Now the enemy troops are heading for Vienna and you should block their way. Some units of our army have retreated panic-stricken. As soon as you have established order among these units, we will send reinforcements. But primarily you will have to contain the pressure of the enemy by yourself. Remember: The future of the Holy Roman Empire depends on your actions.
