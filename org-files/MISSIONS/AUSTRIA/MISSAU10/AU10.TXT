Your victorious actions have contributed greatly to our victory over the enemy. If our troops could have conducted operations in winter as well and we had continued the offensive, the Prussian troops would by now have been totally crushed. Now our enemy has recovered and will most probably strike a blow soon. You are transported into the Elbe region at once. There you will have to take measures to destroy the Prussian troops.
