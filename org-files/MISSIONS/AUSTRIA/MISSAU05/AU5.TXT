Our old enemy Cardinal Richelieu is again trying to ruin our state through scheming. He has recently entered into an alliance with Sweden. France has bound itself to pay Gustav Adolph II one million livres every year to have his troops in Germany threaten the peace of our state. At the beginning of this year, Swedish troops under the command of Leslie occupied the island of Rugen. On July 4th, the Swedish fleet deployed 92 infantry and 16 cavalry companies on Usedom island. War is inevitable and you as one of the most experienced generals must start fortifying the northern borders.
