The victory over the Bohemian army is one of the most famous pages of our battle history. Being one of the key figures of this glorious battle, you have been promoted and received a reward. Cardinal Richelieu has schemed meanly against our state. Not daring to start an open and fair war, he has provoked Denmark into war with us. He is also providing financial aid to our foes. With his assistance, England, the Netherlands and Denmark have entered into an alliance to fight against our victorious army. Having received substantial subsidies from England and the Netherlands, the Danish king has recruited a great number of mercenaries and threatens the borders of our state. Big hopes lay on you. You must secure the northern borders of the empire and neutralise the threat from Denmark. You should also remember the remains of the Czech rebels that may disorganise the rear of the Imperial army.
