Our army has been acting offensively towards Prague in order to crush that nest of rebellion. The Bohemian army under the command of Christian of Anhalt has taken up a defensive position one kilometre south-west of Prague, on the White Mountain. Our army outnumbers the Czech troops and victory is almost in our hands. Your main task is to meet the Polish troops who have arrived to help our army and to organize the supply of their base. Then, after a short preparation, you will lead the Polish troops in the offensive and shatter the enemy army.
