In those troubled times it succeeded in re-establishing the legitimate power and true faith throughout the whole territory of the Holy Roman Empire. You as a true catholic are given a chance to become an officer of the Holy Roman Empire and take part in the process of forming an army. You must leave Vienna today and head for Czechia, where loyal citizens are waiting for you in a small border town. With their help, you will establish a small military settlement and begin recruitment. You must be extremely fast. There is another rebellion in Czechia. The rascals may attack any time.
