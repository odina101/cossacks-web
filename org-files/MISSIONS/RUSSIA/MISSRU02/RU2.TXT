1687
The Ottoman Empire sought to expand its borders and carried out an aggressive policy. An Anti-Turkish Holy League was founded to oppose it in 1684. The League comprised Austria, Poland and Venice. Russia joined the alliance in 1686. Russian forces hoped to crush the Crimean Tatars. On behalf of the great sovereigns John and Peter, Princess Sophia summoned the troops for the campaign against Crimea. First of all, you should recruit and train a strong force. You have 2 months to do so. Then you should move out. A squad of Ukrainian Cossacks led by Hetman Samoylovich will rendezvous with the Russian forces on the Samara River. They will then proceed jointly to the Tatars.
