1696
In 1672, Peter Alekseyevich ascended to the Russian throne. The Tsar was only 10, so it was his sister Sophia who ruled the country. In 1696, Peter himself ruled. He inherited a large but poorly trained, weak army. In 1696, after the death of Polish King Jan Sobesky, Saxon Elector Frederick Augustus became King of Poland, supported by Russia and Saxony. The Polish gentry demanded the recovery of Polish lands captured by Sweden. In 1700, the Russian and Saxon allied army declared war on Sweden, as Tsar Peter claimed he had been treated disrespectfully during a visit to Riga. Russia hoped to recover the lost territories of Karelia and Ingermanland. In this campaign, we face a very dangerous enemy. The Swedish army is one of Europe's best, so thorough preparations are imperative. Firstly, we should build a powerful military base and arrange army supplies. Of course, artillery building and maintenance are paramount. No enemy stronghold can withstand a hail of cannonballs.
