A Window to Europe

Roar of cannons and clank of blades, thousands dead, cities and villages on fire - this was the way Russia passed towards the powerful empire of vast territories and mighty army and navy. Within a short period of time, the state of Russia managed to regenerate - progressive reforms resulted in economic and scientific upsurge, and Russian army was no more an old host of Streletses but a new European-type one. Russia fought its way to the Baltic Sea and promoted active development of merchant and military fleet. At the cost of tremendous human sacrifices and incredible efforts, the new power was born, a giant that dictated its will to the good old Europe of late XVIII century.
