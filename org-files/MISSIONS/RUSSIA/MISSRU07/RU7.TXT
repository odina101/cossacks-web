1709
After his defeat in the north, Charles XII attacked the south. Hetman Mazepa of Ukraine deserted to the Swedish side. Mazepa was considered a loyal ally of the Russian Tsar, and it was like a bolt from the blue for Tsar Peter when the Ukrainian army switched sides. The Swedish army of 25,000 soldiers invaded Ukraine. It now poses a serious threat to Russia. Peter I has decided to drive the Swedes from the captured lands. His army is numerically superior (about 40,000), but the Swedish army is undoubtedly the best disciplined, well-trained and experienced in Europe. Your detachment should enter Ukraine and banish the foe from our lands.
