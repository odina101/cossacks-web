Russia is favourably situated. After gaining Derpt, you are to take Narva by assault. General Sheremetyev's army is near the city of Narva, sheltering a Swedish garrison of 2,000 soldiers led by General Horn. A cavalry detachment of 12,000 riders under the command of Schlippenbach is lodged in Riga and may attack at any moment. Your regiment is transferred to the Narva region in order to besiege Swedish fortifications. You should prepare everything needed for the storm and take the city with minimal losses.
