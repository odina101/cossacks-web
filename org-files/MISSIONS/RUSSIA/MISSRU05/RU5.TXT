1701
The campaign of 1700 was harmful to Sweden, which is now preparing to strike back. Charles XII will try to expand his territory, but surrender approaches to the Baltic Sea. The Swedish army is planning a full-scale offensive against Kurland in May. The key assault point may be the ford of the Daugava river. The enemy outnumbers us. You should prepare your defences and recruit more soldiers. Saxon forces may assist you in the event of a Swedish invasion.
