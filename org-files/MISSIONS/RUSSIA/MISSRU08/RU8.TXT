1714
The crushing defeat of the Swedes in Ukraine was a turning point of the war. The Russian army continued its offensive in the north. In July 1714, they marched along the south of Finland to reach the Gulf of Bothnia. 15,000 soldiers embarked 99 galleys and semi-galleys and advanced to the Abo (Turku) fortress. Sweden tried to hold them back and sent a squad commanded by Rear Admiral Niels Erenscheld (10 vessels: flagship "Elephant", "Flundra", "Mortan", "Simpan", "Ern", "Trana", "Grippen", "Laksen", "Gedeen", "Valfisch", crew of 941). Peter I seized the opportunity to attack the enemy. All Swedish vessels were boarded and captured. This famous triumph heralded the birth not only of a navy, but of the Russian military fleet. Russia has an approach to the Baltic Sea, so a powerful navy is vital now. As an experienced veteran officer, the Tsar commands you to construct shipyards and build up a fleet. You are provided with a sufficient number of workers and soldiers. Remember the war is not over, so Swedes may attack at any moment. If the enemy tries to erect a fortress or military base close to your shipyards, stop him.
