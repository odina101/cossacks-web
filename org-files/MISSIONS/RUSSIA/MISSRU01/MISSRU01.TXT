#PAGE1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 1
  Your squad is off course. Find the correct way to Tetiushi, for any delay may cost you dearly. And take care - predatory Cossacks rule this place.
#PAGE2 Missions\Pictures\russia2 0
  Hey, men! Come on! Cut'em!!
#PAGE3 Missions\Pictures\russia2 4
  He-e-elp! These vermin be stealing my goods!
#PAGE4 Missions\Pictures\russia2 4
  Thank ye kindly, milord! Ye be my redeemer! Yse ...
#PAGE4A Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  Enough, you villein! Do you know the way to Tetiushi?
#PAGE4B Missions\Pictures\russia2 4
  Aye, sure I know, sure I know! Lately we had merry wedding there, an' I come home up in morning. Come on with me, I'll show ye th'way.
#PAGE5 Missions\Pictures\russia2 2
  What's this scum here? Hey men, kill'em!
#PAGE6 Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  You spot a peasant:
  "Hey, villein! Do you know the way to Tetiushi? We must find Razin and are short of time".
#PAGE6A Missions\Pictures\russia2 3
  Why yes, master, sure I do! Come ye along after me, I'll lead ye to the village.
#PAGE7 Missions\Pictures\russia2 3
  Come on, guys! Kill the Tsar's stooges! For Stepan Razin!
#PAGE7A Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  Treachery! You'll pay for this! Be damned, liar! Soldiers, charge!
#PAGE8 Missions\Pictures\russia 4
  Finally you're here, Prince! I was beginning to think that something had gone wrong. You are no under my command. Here is the plan: First of all we need to send a message to our man - there is a ferry to the north ...
#PAGE8A Missions\Pictures\russia 5
  Eat this, you murderer! You shan't plot against Razin again! For Stepan!
#PAGE8D Missions\Pictures\russia 14
  The Voevode has been treacherously killed! Now you should sit tight in Tetiushi and exterminate Razin's squad.
#PAGE8B Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  The traitor is dead! Everyone who is against the Tsar will face a dreadful death! Now I am in command, and I swear on my honour that we will crush Razin!
#PAGE8C Missions\Pictures\russia 23
  In one of Voevode's pockets you have found a message to one of the Tsar's secret agents.
#PAGE9 Missions\Pictures\russia 6
  Guards! Murderers! It's Razin! Run for your lives!
#PAGE10 Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  Hey, ferryman! Over here! From now on you serve the Tsar!
#PAGE10A Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  You approach the ferry and find Razin's flag on it.
  "Whom do you serve, villein?! Vow fidelity to the Tsar or die!"
#PAGE10B Missions\Pictures\russia2 1
  Have mercy on my life, master, in the name of Christ! I swear to serve our father the Tsar for as long as I live! Spare me!
#PAGE11 Missions\Pictures\russia 29
  Excellent! Razin's gang is no more! This ought to be a lesson to the Cossacks not to oppose the Tsar.
#PAGE12 Missions\Pictures\russia 14
  You have died in battle. Russia will remember your feat!
#PAGE12A Missions\Pictures\russia 14
  You have died of starvation. What a horrible death ... Next time, make sure you have enough food.
#PAGE13 Missions\Pictures\russia 3
  You come closer and meet the master of the hunters' house:
  "Who dares to disturb the Tsar's servant?"
#PAGE13A Missions\Pictures\russia 33
  We seek one of the Tsar's agents, who should be living somewhere nearby. Have you seen him?
#PAGE13B Missions\Pictures\russia 3
  What is your business with him?
#PAGE13C Missions\Pictures\russia 33
  We bring a message from the Voevode.
#PAGE13D Missions\Pictures\russia 3
  Give it to me. I've been expecting news from Tetiushi. Wait for reinforcements - I'll send a messenger to Simbirsk.
#PAGE14 Missions\Pictures\england 34
  You have received reinforcements! Five half-galleys are under your command now!
#PAGE15 Missions\Pictures\russia 17
  Finally you have reached Tetiushi! Now you should talk to Voevode Baryatinsky to receive new orders.
#PAGE15A Missions\Pictures\russia 17
  Finally you have reached Tetiushi! But you are too late. The Voevode has died in battle, and Razin is on a rampage in the village.
#PAGE15B Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  Soldiers, charge! Let's drive Razin from the village!
#PAGE15C Missions\Pictures\russia 33
  But we have no reserves, master! Razin's galleys are too tough for our strelets regiments, though some serfs did tell me that the Voevode had spoken of reinforcements and a messenger that we should send across the river.
#PAGE16 Missions\Pictures\russia 6
  Cha-a-arge! Cut'em, men! Disembowel them!
#PAGE17 Missions\Pictures\russia 11
  Shoot, brothers! Drive them from the Cossacks' land!
#PAGE18 Missions\Pictures\russia2 0
  Halt! Razin says that no-one may walk here! We will kill you who go against the will of Razin!
#PAGE19 Missions\Pictures\russia2 3
  Hey, men! Come on! Cut the Tsar's minions!
#PAGE20 Missions\Pictures\russia 11
  You come across a camp of robbers. "Ha! Look at this dinner party! A herd of swine with a hog at the head! Kill'em, brothers! Kill'em all!"
#PAGE20A Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  You'll pay for the "hog", you rogue! Soldiers, shoot them!
#PAGE21 Missions\Pictures\russia2 3
  Kill'em, men! Kill the scum!!
#PAGE22 Missions\Pictures\mord_n 3
  In the middle of the razed camp, your soldiers found a cauldron filled with hot skilly. Not too fastidious about bandits' food, your soldiers have filled their stomachs.
#PAGE23 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 27
  All your soldiers are suffering from severe diarrhoea. You must stop your march. Let us hope their condition was caused by robbers' soup, not typhoid fever.
#PAGE24 Missions\Pictures\russia 7
  You reach a village: "At last! Hey, villein! Is this Tetiushi?"
#PAGE24A Missions\Pictures\russia 10
  The Lord be with you, master! This is Terenga. Tetiushi is that way, to the north, behind the hills.
#PAGE25 Missions\Pictures\russia 33
  You meet the manager of a mine: "Hey, man! Do you know the Tsar's agent? I have a letter for him."
#PAGE25A Missions\Pictures\russia 2
  There are no agents here! This is the Tsar's mine, not his office! Go to the north. There you will meet a hermit beside the water. Ask him. Now go, don't waste my time.
