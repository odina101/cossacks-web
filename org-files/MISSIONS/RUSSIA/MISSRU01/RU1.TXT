1670
In May 1667, fugitive Cossacks commanded by Stepan Razin dragged their boats from Don to Volga. They plundered caravans of the exchequer, patriarchy and merchantmen. Several strelets detachments tried in vain to put an end to these raids. Razin decided to conquer Moscow and marched towards the city. In spring 1670, he gained Tsaristyn (Volgograd). The Tsar dispatched streletses under the command of Prince Lvov to suppress the mutineers. On June 22nd, Razin's Cossacks gained Astrakhan by force, then seized Saratov. Major forces led by Voevode Baryatinskiy opposed them. As a young nobleman, you are instructed to head a strelets detachment and assist the tsarist Voevode Baryatinskiy, who suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Simbirsk (Ulyanovsk). Major mutineer forces are positioned near Simbirsk, trying to take the city. You are not yet experienced, but the Tsar believes you can cope with the rebels.
