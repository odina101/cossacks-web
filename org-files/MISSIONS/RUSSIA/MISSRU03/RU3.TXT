1689
Despite the success of 1687, the Tatars remain strong enough to endanger Russia. A new campaign against the Crimea is imperative, and in early 1689 Russia is preparing for the war. Mazepa, the new Hetman of Ukraine, is prepared to join the Russian army with his forces. The rally points are the towns of Oboyan, Rylsk, Chuguyev and Sumy. The campaign is scheduled for early spring, in order to avoid steppe fires and guarantee sufficient water supplies and rich pastures for the horses.
