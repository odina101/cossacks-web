You control a Turkish city. 
Your territory has no deposits. You will have to trade food for stone with your allies on the island. 
Have your main character approach the merchant at the market and agree to outfit trade caravans. 
When you liberate the allied town, you'll be able to purchase cannons from the officer at the artillery depot in the east, and then trade food with the town for a good profit.   
Your opponent receives big coal supplies from an ally in the north-east, across the sea. It would be wise for you to neutralise that ally.
