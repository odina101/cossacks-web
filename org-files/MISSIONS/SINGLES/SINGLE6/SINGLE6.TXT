A seaport and the Saxon navy are at your command. You are to develop and enforce your fleet to carry out operations at sea. To defeat cities and enemy armies on land, the most effective would be to use ketches, as well as frigates and 18th century ships of the line.  
A transport provides your shipyards with regular supplies (white frigate). Ensure the transport is protected, for it can be sunk by enemy ships.
