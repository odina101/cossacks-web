Victory will be yours only if you are able to break the alliance of Bavaria, Prussia and Saxony! The Prussians have discovered your location and sent military vessels to meet you! Demolish the shipyards on the Prussian island (4 in total) to stop their attacks.  
Blow up or capture the Prussian town hall, where their headquarters are located, to deprive the Prussian forces of their command. Otherwise Prussia will launch a full-scale attack against you.

It will be next to impossible for you to handle the Prussian fleet on your own! The assistance of the strong Russian navy is vital. To gain the Russian support you must make your way to the Russian island in a fast cutter. If you lose the cutter, build a new one and move on to your ally.
