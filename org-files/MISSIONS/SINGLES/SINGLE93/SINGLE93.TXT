You are in command of the Danish frontier squadron on the border of the kingdom of Denmark. The squad controls the frontier region. 
The local Bavarian baron (blue) regularly attacks the region. 
The king has authorised you to exterminate the baron if he dares to cross the border again. Be careful, though! The baron is said to have a large and well-equipped squadron at his manor.

Your task is to keep the baron's troops out of the kingdom and guard the settlements and gold mines (orange). 
The mines provide you with gold and the settlements supply food.
