You control a small cossack settlement on the shore of a big river. The settlement is located on rich lands, with plenty of resources and dense woods around, while the waters of the wide river are full of fish. But there is fierce conflict over possession of this world ...       
Beyond the bridge that spans an arm of a big river, a competing state is exploring the lands. Its borders lie along the water. The stance of that state is rather aggressive, it does not tolerate foreign settlers on these lands.    
Near your settlement, honest prospectors exploit deposits. 
However, prospectors are quite peaceful and do not engage in conflict with anybody. 
Will you be able to retain your positions, build a city, develop a fleet and take the power in your hands?

A delegation of neighbouring prospectors has arrived in your village:
- May you have peace in your lands! We are free prospectors, your neighbours, and come to you in peace. We exploit deposits and procure metals and coal from our mines to the west.  
If you do not treat us with hostility, we think it is likely we will be able to keep up a good neighbourly relationship. 
We treat our neighbours well, unless of course they attack and capture our mines ... 
The land is rich and has enough resources for everybody. Good luck!

A message has arrived from the leader of the prospectors: 
"Dear neighbour. The assault on our mines was a treacherous and short-sighted act! From now on, we cease to regard you as friendly and forbid you to enter our territory. You will regret your act of aggression."
