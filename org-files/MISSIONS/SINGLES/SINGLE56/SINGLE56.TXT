{A} The Central Post
 
Your objective is to neutralise the alliance of Poland, Saxony and Bavaria. Poland and Saxony can be defeated with land troops, but naval forces are required to defeat Bavaria. 
The assistance of your ally, France, will be of great help to you. The French are positioned on the south-western isle.  
You will lose if your troops are defeated, or if you fail to hold the island (i.e. if your military units are numerically far inferior to the enemy).

You must neutralise the alliance of Poland, Saxony and Bavaria! It will be difficult to beat the enemies with your own forces, so ask your allies on the south-western island for help. To gain their support you will need to send them packhorses loaded with valuable cargo. Beware, Saxon ships patrol the sea!

A Saxon sea patrol has spotted your ships! Now the Saxons will attack your shipyards to deprive you of the possibility to build a strong fleet. Your workers cannot build shipyards, but your ally will provide you with peasants. To stop the Saxon attacks, destroy their 2 shipyards on the north-eastern island.

The Saxons have discovered your location and sent soldiers and cavalry to meet you! To stop the Saxon attacks, you must destroy or capture their town hall in the north-west.
