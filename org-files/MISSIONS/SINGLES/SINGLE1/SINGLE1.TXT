A small seaport. Defending it are a squad of infantrymen and a galleass fleet. 
Its residents are civilians, fully dependent on the local powers. They cannot create an army, as there is nobody among them to train and lead soldiers into battle (and they have no means to build a barracks and stables). 
Due to the lack of troops in the city, the fleet of ships bears the burden of defending the city against the enemy. That is why Venetian galleasses protect the narrow accesses to the city in the west and east.

The king ordered the future city commandant and army commander, a general, to sail off to his destination. But his ship was attacked by the galleys of the Turkish fleet on the way. 
The Turks were able to capture the general. They imprisoned him in a dungeon on the island (orange town hall).

To build a barracks and stables and create an army, the citizens must free the general and take him from the island into the city. 
To release the general, capture the orange town hall on the island.
