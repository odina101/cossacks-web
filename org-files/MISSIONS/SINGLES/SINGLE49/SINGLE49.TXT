Break the alliance of Bavaria and Denmark! The Bavarians have taken up positions in a fortress to the south-east. They have learned of your arrival on the island and sent soldiers to meet you! Neutralise the Bavarians as soon as possible, otherwise they will launch a full-scale attack against you!
There is also a camp of bandits who have escaped from the Bavarian prisons to the south. Eliminate them!

Your workers cannot build an artillery depot, and it will be hard for you to deal with the Bavarians without multi-barrelled cannons! Deliver packhorses with ammunition to your ally's storehouse (on the eastern border of the isle), and he will give you peasants for some time!
