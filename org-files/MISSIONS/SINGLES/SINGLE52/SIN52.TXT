In this mission you will have to defeat the violet player in the lower left part of the map. Two more players will oppose you. One of them is located in the left part of the map, another one is below your base.
There are also neutral Bavarian camps on the map, guarded by towers. Later in the game one of the camps will yield to the weakest player.
You can destroy the guard towers only after the camp surrenders to the enemy.
Don't make the mistake of thinking it will be an easy victory. You can't build a market and the second stone upgrade in the academy is unavailable.
