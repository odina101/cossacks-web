#Entry0 missions\pictures\austria 10
The King of Sweden has decided to expand his domain and captured lands on the territory of the Danes. You have received news that the colony is in danger!
The king orders you to set off to the fort and take command.

#Trans missions\pictures\austria 10
At last you have arrived. A fort is now under your command. 
Allow me to put you in the picture:
On close inspection we have discovered that these lands hold few gold deposits. This has considerably hampered our development. 
However, we have not lost heart, but have arranged trade with our northern neighbours. It has been our salvation: Their gold is cheaper than grass. Trade is possible only if you have a market available. 
But there is distressing news too. These uninhabited lands are teeming with all kinds of brigands. Most of them are French convicts on the run.  
On top of that, the Danes have been preparing a campaign and are about to drive us from these lands. 

#Target0 missions\pictures\austria 10
Only the total defeat of the Danish will secure your victory. Good luck! 

#LittleMoney missions\pictures\austria 10

#Defeat missions\pictures\austria 10

#Victory missions\pictures\austria 10
