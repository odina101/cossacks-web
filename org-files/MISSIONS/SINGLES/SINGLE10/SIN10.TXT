You have taken the side of Sweden. Your enemies are the well-trained Saxon troops. The military operations will take place on both dry and waterlogged strips of land in the swamps between your position and the forces of Saxony.
Your task is to defeat the enemy. 
But that is not all. Be careful and prepared to drive off the bandits lurking in the swamp.
