You must neutralise the alliance of Bavaria and Prussia! The French, supporters of the alliance, have discovered your nearby location and sent soldiers towards you! To stop the French attacks, demolish the town hall that houses their command staff.  
  
#PAGE0A Missions\Pictures\faces 31
Officers of the Austrian army have arrived to the south-west and south-east to help you defeat your opponent! But they are short of wood for initial development. Therefore you should collect 2,000 wood, load it onto packhorses and deliver it to the commanders. Besides, you must protect the officers and their peasants from French attacks.

You already have the necessary amount of resources to send to the officers of the Austrian army!  
Dispatch packhorses to the storehouse for loading. 

#PAGE10A Missions\Pictures\austria 4
Packhorses loaded! Send one of them to the commander of the western front, and the other to the commander of the eastern front. If both packhorses go to one commander, he will take them both and you won't be able to deliver wood to the other commander. 

#PAGE12  Missions\Pictures\mord_d 6
You have lost a packhorse and won't be able to deliver resources to one of the commanders! Now it will be harder to defeat your adversaries! 

#PAGE13 Missions\Pictures\faces 13
Ah! You have delivered the necessary initial resources! We will begin with development straight away, so that our combined forces may defeat the enemy alliance! 
(Guards must not stand too close to the peasants, as space is required for development.)
