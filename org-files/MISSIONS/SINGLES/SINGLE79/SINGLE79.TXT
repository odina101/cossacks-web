{Q}	Resentment

In this mission you will act under the banner of Great Britain. Your ally is on the other side of the island. To the north of your island lie trade routes of the English (orange). There are also two islands rich in resources in the north. They are controlled by pirates.
The goal of the mission is to defeat the nation of the King of Spain's nephew (blue). The blue player is on the continent to the east of your island. Spanish merchant ships keep your enemy supplied with gold. Try to neutralise them.
The continent is controlled by the hostile French.

!You will lose if your army is eliminated. 

{Z} 
Hints:
{A}	The king's relative is in the south-east.
{S}	The grandee has two allies, Spain and France.
{D}	On the opposite side of the island you can acquire ships from friends.
{F}	Guard the English transports (white ketches) in the north; your ally (orange) will share his resources.
{G}	To the north of your island lie enemy trade routes. Destroy the enemy transport ships (black ketches).

The betrayal costs you dearly. You have lost your lands. In addition, the King of England has taken away the gold you worked so hard to earn.
However, taking into account your military experience, you have been made a lord and sent to defend the southern border of the kingdom.
The Spanish grandee cannot forget the old insult. Having saved a necessary amount of gold and discovered your location, he sets off on his last campaign. 
Beware of the pirates.
