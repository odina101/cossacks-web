In this mission you will face the Spanish monarch himself. 
By disobeying the king's orders you have incurred his wrath. You are also opposed by the king's nephew and the French marquis. The king has suborned the local lords to attack you.
Repel the king's attacks and try to contact the French merchant in the upper right-hand corner of the map.
Save the gold.
