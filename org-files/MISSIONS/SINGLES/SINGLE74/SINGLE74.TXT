{Q}	No Way Out
  
The glare of the gold has dazzled you so much, you now consider yourself a king.
Insulting the Spanish monarch is to invite trouble. 
Apart from the king, his nephew, the French marquis, also opposes you. The king has suborned the local feudal lords so that they will attack from time to time.
It seems there's no way out ...
!You will lose if your army is eliminated.
 
Current objectives:
{W}	Establish trade with your northern neighbour.
{I}	~Establish trade with your northern neighbour.~
{Z}	France is our only hope. The merchant should arrange a deal. Keep the trade going.
{X}	~France is our only hope. The merchant should arrange a deal. Keep the trade going.~
{E}	Build a shipyard in the north-east and send a messenger to the island to begin negotiations with England. 
{R}	~Build a shipyard in the north-east and send a messenger to the island to begin negotiations with England.~
{T}	Deliver packhorses laden with gold to the English on the island.
{Y}	~Deliver packhorses laden with gold to the English on the island.~
{L}
  
Hints: 
{A}	Save your gold, you will need it.
{S}	Apart from offering cheap food, the French merchant also has useful information.
{D}	If you pay the French merchant, the brigands will take your side.
{F}	You can hire the merchant only if you have a market and a town hall.

#Trans missions\pictures\austria 10
At last you are here. The fort is under your command.
Allow me to put you in the picture:
On close inspection we have discovered that these lands hold few gold deposits. This has considerably hampered our development.
However, we have not lost heart, but have arranged trade with our northern neighbours. It has been our salvation: Their gold is cheaper than grass. Trade is possible only if you have a market available.
But there is distressing news too. These uninhabited lands are teeming with all kinds of brigands. Most of them are French convicts on the run.
On top of that, the Danes have been preparing a campaign and are about to drive us from these lands.

#Target0 missions\pictures\austria 10
You will win if you totally eliminate the Danish troops. Good luck!



#NeedHall missions\pictures\austria 10

Your resources are insufficient.

#ai0_entry missions\pictures\austria 10
There's an English base not far from your location.
They have recently suffered heavy losses. This is your chance to capture their worker and even destroy them with a single blow.

#ai0_surrender missions\pictures\austria 10
You are a dangerous opponent. We don't want to die. Our commander has decided to surrender.



#eng_capture missions\pictures\austria 10

I am pleased to be able to inform you that the Frenchman says he can arrange a deal with the brigands for a certain amount of gold. They will attack your enemy for some time.
I'll remind you about this offer before the next campaign.


#bayband0 missions\pictures\austria 10

I have agreed to let the Frenchman know your decision the next time I see him.
He wants %d gold for his services.

#bayband1 missions\pictures\austria 10
Do you want to pay the Frenchman?

#bayband2 missions\pictures\austria 10
Now the king will be busy with the brigands for a while.

#bayband3 missions\pictures\austria 10
The time you bought from the brigands has run out. They will attack you again.

#no_bayband missions\pictures\austria 10
You don't have enough resources to strike a deal. I suggest we cancel the campaign and accumulate the necessary amount of gold.
Do you want to cancel the campaign?

#eng_news0 missions\pictures\austria 10
The Frenchman says his English cousin can help us. Build a shipyard in the north-west to negotiate with the English.

#NeedContact missions\pictures\austria 10
You have built a shipyard. Build a yacht and head for the northern coast of the island occupied by the English.

The gold will stay with us and you had better get out of here.

#kupec_defeat missions\pictures\austria 10
