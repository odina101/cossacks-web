You are assigned as governor of a Portuguese colony. Develop and protect it.  
To develop your colony and carry out combat operations, transport vessels will be needed. 
Build a ship, load it with iron and send it to the Turkish port, where you can exchange your iron for a transport vessel. 
Beware of pirates rampaging in the area.
