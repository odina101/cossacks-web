The army of Saxon Prince Frederick Augustus has formed an alliance with Austria in the war against France. Your newly formed company has been assigned to take part in the campaign. 
You will cover the flank of the victorious Saxon army and keep it supplied with ammunition and food. To that end you must take an economically and militarily advantageous area and build up a military base, i.e. a barracks, a wooden fort and a stable. You must outfit a small mounted squad to patrol the roads. Light cavalry units are best suited to this task. 
Be careful, the French are insidious. Be prepared to repel their attacks any time.
