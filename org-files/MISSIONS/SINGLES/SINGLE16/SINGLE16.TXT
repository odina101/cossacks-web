My lord! I am a simple peasant, who lives in the village nearby. The road to the village has been blocked by bandits. 
My lord, I beg you: Clear the road of bandits. 
In the village I will help you recruit mounted militia from among the peasants. 

#PAGE1 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
My lord, you have fought bravely and our militia will gladly join your troops. Our peasants are barefoot and badly armoured. They need to be equipped and armed first. This will cost 1,000 in gold. Agreed?  

#PAGE2 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
I am glad to see you again, my lord. Our militia will readily join you. 
Are you ready now to equip and arm the squad? As before, it will cost you 1,000 in gold. 

#PAGE3 Missions\Pictures\poland 23
The peasant has died. The militia won't join you. Everyone has lost faith in you. 

#PAGE4 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
My packhorse has been destroyed. The militia won't join you. 

#PAGE5 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
Thank you for your assistance! Now the road to the village is clear of bandits. Let's go to the village, my lord. The militiamen await.  

#PAGE6 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
It's a pity you are short of money. When you have 1,000 in gold, come back to see me again. 

#PAGE7 Missions\Pictures\poland 2
The peasant has reached the village. Now send soldiers to the village with a packhorse to visit the peasant. He will offer to reinforce your troops with militiamen.

Bandits are camped on the hill to the north-east of your settlement. They are harassing the locals, robbing mines and attacking merchants and packhorses. 
Until you wipe out all the bandits in the camp, they will keep raiding the mines and town.
