As governor of a French colony, you must break the alliance of Algeria and Turkey and defeat your opponents. If you fail to do this, the peace of your colony will be constantly threatened by its enemies. 
Use the king's musketeers under your command to protect any packhorses you send to the city.  
Having paid the nomads (their camp is located in the west), you can arrange incursions into the rich sands.
