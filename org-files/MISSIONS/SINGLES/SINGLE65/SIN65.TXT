In this mission you are in command of the Saxon army. Military operations will take place in the plains. There will be no ally to help you against the Austrian forces. 
Your main task is to destroy the enemy packhorses and prevent them from reaching the passage. If you do not succeed, all your efforts to complete the mission will be in vain.
