After a long, fruitless search for the pirates who destroyed the English and Spanish convoy and captured a large amount of gold, many English lords and Spanish grandees refused to continue to seek the treasures. 
However, the other day a dirty plebeian in one of the brothels claimed there were huge treasures hidden on an unnamed island.
He said he was a sailor, a crewman on one of three beautiful ships whose holds were full of gold. When passing by an unnamed island, a riot broke out on one of the frigates. The ships were seriously damaged and could no longer carry the gold. The greater part of the treasures was taken ashore and buried. He claims to know where it lies.
Alas, you are not the only one who has heard this story. Two of your rivals also claim the gold.
