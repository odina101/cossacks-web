In this mission England, allied with the Netherlands, is at war with Spain and Sweden. 
As an officer in the English army, you have been assigned to the northern island. 
Spain's allies, the Swedes, have taken advantage of their powerful navy to capture the central territories and constantly patrol the area with their ships of the line. 
The Dutch fleet is not powerful enough to hold its own against Sweden. 
Therefore you must help them develop their fleet and build up your own.
Together you'll be able to defeat your rivals.
