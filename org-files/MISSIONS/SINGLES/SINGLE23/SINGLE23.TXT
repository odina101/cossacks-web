{A}The Sea Patrol
 
Your objective is to defeat the alliance of Sweden and Spain. To accomplish this you must help your ally - the Netherlands - to develop a fleet until there are 18th century ships of the line, which will be able to neutralise the Swedish navy and enable you to create your own fleet. Then clear the northern island of Spanish forces.   
You will lose if the main character dies or if you are unable to protect your allies. 
Only your main character can speak to your allies!
