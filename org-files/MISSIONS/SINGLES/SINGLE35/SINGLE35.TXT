Neutralise the alliance of Denmark and France! Bandits have been rampaging in the area where you arrived, ready for anything if there is gold to be gained. 
Destroy their camp to the east!

An officer of the Venetian army, the commander of the eastern front, has arrived in the south-east to help you cope with your opponents! But he has no peasants to develop with. Therefore, you must gather no less than 30 of your own peasants and take them to the commander as soon as possible. Also, you should protect the officer and peasants so they can create a powerful army.
