{A} The Sultan's Island
 
Your objective is to break the alliance of Turkey and Algeria. To accomplish this, it should be enough to kill the Turkish sultan (orange), who is on the island to the west. Be careful, the Turks have the Black Sea under their control and are blocking the land passageways. Besides, you must free your peasants from captivity, for they possess information valuable to you. 
You will lose if your troops are defeated, or if you fail to release the captives.   

Current objectives:
{B}Kill the Turkish sultan (orange Turkish officer) on the island to the west. 
{C}~Kill the Turkish sultan (orange Turkish officer) on the island to the west.~
{D}Free the captive peasants in the south-west. 
{E}~Free the captive peasants in the south-west.~
{F}Destroy the Turkish post in the south.~

You must break the alliance of Turkey and Algeria! To accomplish this, kill the commander of the allied troops: the Turkish sultan (orange Turkish officer) on the island to the west!

Unfortunately your peasants cannot build shipyards! That is why you need to free the captive workers in one of the two forts in the south-west. They can construct shipyards! Be careful, if the captives die you won't be able to reach the sultan on the island and your mission will fail!

The Turks have blocked the way from north to south! They are alert and have sent soldiers towards you! Destroy their post to the south! The passageway to the south-west is controlled by Turkish ships! To stop them, demolish the shipyards on the sultan's island (to the west). To accomplish this you need to build your own shipyard!
