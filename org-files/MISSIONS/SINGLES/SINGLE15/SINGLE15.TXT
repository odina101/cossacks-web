Neutralise the alliance of Piemonte and England! 
The area you have arrived at holds one gold mine. This gold mine and a market - the crucial resource objects - are at your disposal. 
Protect these structures from brigands!

In the middle of the map there is an island rich in resources! It is controlled by France, your ally. The French have built mines on the island and are prepared to give them to you to control. As soon as possible, reach their fort in the east and the French will help you get to the island.  
If the English destroy the mine on the island you will be deprived of resources and your mission will fail!

Greetings, Commander! 
Immediately break through to the island in the centre of the map with your Bavarian troops. Our people there will assist you! 
I will give you the fastest ship I have, but I need your help in exchange. I beg you, help us to defend the northern fort borders from brigands. Our crucial structures are in your hands. 
The brigands long to desecrate our sanctuary - the church. Stop them!  
To stop the brigand attacks, destroy their base to the north-east.

You have made your way to the island rich in resources and now it is at your disposal! Protect all the mines on the island from English sea attacks! To that end, demolish the English shipyard to the north-west of your island (on Piemontese territory). One more thing: Don't let the English develop on the island located to the north-east of your one.
