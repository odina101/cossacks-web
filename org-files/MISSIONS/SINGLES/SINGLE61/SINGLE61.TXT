Victory!

#PAGE23 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 39
The allied forces of Spain and Portugal have been fighting with England and France on the continent. You must help them. The Turkish fleet controls the sea, so you will have to transport troops and trade with the help of merchants who have concluded non-aggression pacts with Turkey. If you need to send your troops across the water, take them to the shipyard to board the ferry. 
Your mamelukes can arrange trade with your allies near the storehouses in their territory. Your allies will send you the packhorses. Build up a fleet, take control of the sea and destroy the English and French troops.
