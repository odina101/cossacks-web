The valorous Piemontese forces are opposed by the French and Austrian armies. They threaten the peace of the region. You must repel them at any cost!
Unfortunately, your builders have lost the plans for the academy. Therefore, you can't build it initially. You must take the squad to the academy in the centre of the Venetian town (orange) to obtain the necessary plans.
However, always remember this region is a very dangerous place.
There is no time to lose! It is reported that our insidious and greedy enemy has been preparing for a bloody and merciless war in this blossoming region.

All you need to do is approach the academy in the centre to seek information.
