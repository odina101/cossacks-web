As an officer of the Spanish army, you have been ordered to neutralise the alliance of Austria, England and Denmark! To fulfil your orders, you are to defeat the Austrians who have captured one of the two eastern isles. 
The English have found out about your arrival on the island and will launch naval attacks against you. 
Enter your Saxon allies' fort to the north and they will assist you in repelling the English attacks! 
To stop the English attacks for good, demolish their ports on the eastern islands (two shipyards on the northern isle, and two on the southern isle).

Your colleague - the commander of the northern front - has arrived on an island to the north. He requires initial resources for development. Therefore you need to collect 5,000 of all resource types and deliver them on packhorses to the commander of the northern front.  
Use a Saxon transport ship to send packhorses to the northern island.
