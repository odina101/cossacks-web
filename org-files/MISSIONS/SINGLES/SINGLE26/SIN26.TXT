In this mission the alliance of Spain and Saxony is at war with the alliance of Austria, England and Denmark. 
Military operations will take place on four islands. 
As an officer in the Spanish army, you have been assigned to take command of the southern army. You are under orders to land on the south-western island and neutralise the Austrians on one of the western islands. However, you are not alone in this quest. A colleague and friend of yours who is also a Spanish officer has arrived at the north-western island and is in charge of the northern army. He will help you. 
Your main strategic task is to defeat the Austrian troops. 
It is a well-known fact that Austria is the most dangerous enemy out of the three. Its troops are strong, disciplined and well-armed. England and Denmark won't be a match for you without Austria.
