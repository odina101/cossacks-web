You have always strived to possess so far uninhabited lands. Now you have such an opportunity. Landing with a mass of people in this region, you have built a fort that few people know of. The owner of the land lives in the fortress on the island.
By capturing the fortress you will become the owner of the land.

Commercial counsellor: 
"The fortress receives a constant supply of food and ammunition by packhorse. I shall buy up the packhorses and Polish peasants and take them to the zone behind the paling near the storehouse. As soon as I have 500 packhorses I will buy this land from the king for you." (Select the market to find out how many packhorses have been captured.)
