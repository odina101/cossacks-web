The Ukrainian hetman is heading towards us to demand money again. 
Unless we want war with Ukraine, you had better keep some money aside. 
 
#PAGE2 Missions\Pictures\Ukraine 10
Greetings, sir! 
You want peace with us? 
For 1,000 gold we will agree not to attack for some time. 
So ... agreed? 

#PAGE3 Missions\Pictures\Ukraine 10
Good! 
You are rich, friends, so pay us 1,000 more gold, then we can make a deal with the Muscovites for you. 
So, are we agreed?  

#PAGE4 Missions\Pictures\Ukraine 10
Take care!
See you again soon. 
Keep a pretty supply of money, and my men will be sure to take a stroll around your territory now and then, just in case ...

Prepare for war!
