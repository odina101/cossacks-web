By order of King Louis XIII, you are sent to seek out new lands. 
New settlers headed by a squad of brave musketeers of the king have just landed on the picturesque shore of the ocean island abundant in resources. 
Your objective is to defend this beautiful island from enemy assaults and regain control over other islands in the area.    
You will also have to oppose the pirates. 
Pirates possess formidable high-speed frigates with fairly good guns. In the ocean there are some areas totally controlled by pirates.  
There is no time to spare! Reports state that the enemy has been amassing armaments and is preparing a fleet to fight with you over possession of the island.

Unfortunately, you proved unable to cope with your task. The king is disappointed that he does not have the islands under control.
