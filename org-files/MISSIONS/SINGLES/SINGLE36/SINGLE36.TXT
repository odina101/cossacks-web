The 18th century. Russian troops are conducting operations against the armies of Poland and Turkey. A combatant squad of battle-hardened Russian cavalrymen under your command (hussar) is on its way back from the campaign. 
You are near the south-western borders of the Russian Empire.
You must reach a village in the north-east. Scouts have reported unrest and possible enemy regular subdivisions in the area.   
The hussar must survive the mission.
