Turkey has declared war on Austria and attacked its territories. The Ottoman Empire is strong and its troops are numerous, quite capable of conquering the Holy Roman Empire. One goal of the campaign is Vienna, the Austrian capital. 
Your troops are on the flank of the main army. You will have to suppress the locals and strengthen your hold on the captured territory. 
You will have to install defences and barracks for your troops. 
Though our troops advance victoriously, you should beware of enemy counterattacks.
