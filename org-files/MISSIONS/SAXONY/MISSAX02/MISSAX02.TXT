You are to defend gold mines from Turkish raids. Hire troops and annihilate everyone who seeks the King's gold. When you have 15,000 in gold, load it on packhorses and transport it to the fortress to the north-east.

Sir! Much gold has been accumulated. As soon as the gold is loaded on the packhorses, you should gather all your troops and take the packhorses to the river. There will be a ferry waiting for you.

Sir! The road before you is divided in two. The northern path is controlled by brigands, but you can make a deal with them. Follow the eastern fork, and you will be heading into a Turkish ambush. Beware!

You have lost the packhorses!
 #PAGE3  Missions\Pictures\england 25
Sir! The packhorses are ready... Oh, we have bad news. Extensive Turkish troops are approaching from the south-east. You had better leave the camp through the northern gates!
