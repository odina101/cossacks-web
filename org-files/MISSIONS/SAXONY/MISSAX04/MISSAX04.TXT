The Saxon army under the command of its king has crossed the Swedish border and is preparing for a large-scale offensive. However, the local citizens refuse to yield to the king's will. They are conducting raids and robbing wagon trains, assaulting small squads and poisoning the water. You must quell the revolt in this region and destroy the Swedish town hall to the north-east. If need be, you can hire cavalry and artillery at our allies' fortress.
