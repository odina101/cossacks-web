An affluent country, its treasuries filled with gold, satiated and content civilians, cheery merchants and industrious peasants. What more could be required to make this idyll of German life complete? Perhaps a brave officer and a mighty army, for it will not be long before hostile soldiers appear along the borders. The enemies are impatient to treat themselves to the fruits of other people's labour, plunder and ruin their successful neighbours. If you seek peace, you had better prepare for war ... and preferably wage it on somebody else's territory.
