Swedish troops have captured some of the citizens and are detaining them in a fort to the north-west. Soon Swedish ferries will embark and take them far away to be sold as slaves. You are to hire troops in the settlements nearby and try to free the peasants.

  Sir! I have knowledge of your campaign and have prepared a detachment for you. Take it and return victorious. 
#PAGE3 Missions\Pictures\england 17
 Sir, rumour has it that you are in need of my cavalry. But I will not leave it to you for nothing! It will cost you 3,000 in gold.
#PAGE5 Missions\Pictures\england 8
  Sir! I have had word of your noble campaign, but I cannot give you my people and leave the village defenceless. If you could dispel the gang camping in the west, we could reach an agreement.  
#PAGE6 Missions\Pictures\mord_d 6
 You have destroyed the camp of brigands!
#PAGE7 Missions\Pictures\russia 27
  You have freed our village from the bandits. I am grateful to you. My garrison is at your disposal. 
#PAGE8 Missions\Pictures\england 8
  Speak! Who is the leader among you? We want to sell him this gun for 5,000 in gold.
#PAGE9 Missions\Pictures\austria 13
 Finally you've arrived. I have prepared artillery for you and will accompany you on your campaign.
#PAGE10 Missions\Pictures\faces 23
 Halt! Who goes there? This road is controlled by my squad. It will cost you 5,000 pieces of gold to pass through our fortifications! So pass through the gateway and pay.
#PAGE20 Missions\Pictures\faces 23
Then I will take all your money. My ruffians will teach you a lesson!
#PAGE11 Missions\Pictures\faces 23
 Are these all the volunteers for the other side?
#PAGE12 Missions\Pictures\faces 5
 ... so for %d people you must pay me %d in gold!
#PAGE13 Missions\Pictures\austria 35
 Excellent! You have liberated the peasants! Now you bring them to the village in the south. 
#PAGE14 Missions\Pictures\mord_d 0
 Bad news, sir. A substantial Swedish force is approaching from the north to cut off our way back. The only way out is to capture enemy ferries and escape by sea. 
#PAGE15 Missions\Pictures\Russia 34
 The ferries have been captured!
#PAGE16 Missions\Pictures\england 10
  You have perished and failed to accomplish the mission!
#PAGE17 Missions\Pictures\austria 43
 Many captives died. Their deaths are on your conscience! Mission failed.
#PAGE18 Missions\Pictures\austria 3
Well done! You have returned the captives to their native village. It wasn't easy.
