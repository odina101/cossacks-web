  You and your small reconnaissance squad have returned to the fortress. Your worst premonitions proved true: There are a lot of Spaniards to finish off all around. Proceed to the chief in the middle of the fortress to report on the situation and receive new orders.

  Things are even worse than I expected! There are too many Spaniards. I live in fear lest they should counterattack. But I realize your goal is of greater importance, that is why I'll run the risk of weakening the defences of the fortress and giving you a howitzer.
