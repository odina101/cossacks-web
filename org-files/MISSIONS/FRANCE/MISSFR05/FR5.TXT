1638
The time France spent preparing for the war and reforming the army was not wasted. Despite a large number of mercenaries remaining in the French army, France is now able to successfully hold back the hardy Imperial army. French generals have been successful in last year's campaign and managed to not only recapture native lands but also to move the battleground towards enemy territory. Due to the progress of its army, France has gained new allies: the Netherlands, Mantua, Venice and Savoy.
Major operations have shifted to Italian and Spanish territories. After numerous battles, France finally managed to press the numerically superior enemy. Germany, drained by the long war, is running low on manpower, but is a strong enemy, nevertheless. You receive new orders from your commander:
"Colonel,
The latest developments at the front are favourable to France. Our intensive assaults have deprived the enemy of the time he needs to regroup and recover. Your new mission is vital to the whole offensive. I order you and your regiment to advance to the east and capture the fortress. It is the key stronghold of the northern Spanish territories. The Imperial garrison is quite strong and fully capable of counterattacking. Assaulting the fortress without artillery is unthinkable, thus I am assigning several batteries to your regiment."
