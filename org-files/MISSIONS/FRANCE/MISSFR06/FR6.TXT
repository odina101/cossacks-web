1640
The new year has brought no changes to the course of action. The French army is slowly driving the German forces back, but is sustaining heavy losses. The most important events took place in Belgium, near the Arras fortress. French forces under the command of Prince Condes strove to seize the citadel, but had to crush major Imperial forces first. You receive a new directive from you commander:
"Colonel,
At present, well-fortified Imperial lines are covering all strategic positions along the approach to the fortress. The battle plan comprises two parts. First of all, we must drive the enemy from the hills and gain a foothold there. If we succeed, we will obtain tactical advantages and a better chance of triumph. To do this, we will simulate an offensive to distract the enemy's major forces. At the same time, two squads should attack the hills from east and west. Colonel, considering your experience, I am assigning you to lead the eastern assault squad. I have every faith in you and trust you will not fail me at this crucial moment."
