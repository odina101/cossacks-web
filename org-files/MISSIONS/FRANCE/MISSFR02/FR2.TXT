1631
Under Habsburg rule, Austria was one of the most influential European states opposing France. It was part of the Empire and played a vital role due to its powerful army. In the 16th century, Austria formed an alliance with its less powerful neighbours. Facing the peril of Turkish invasion, Czechia joined Austria. The Austrian Habsburg dynasty swiftly and aggressively expanded its influence in Europe, gained numerous victories in the Thirty Years' War and posed a serious threat to France. Cardinal Richelieu brought France into the Thirty Years' War to oppose the Habsburg dynasty. However, France was too weak for full-scale war and instead waged a political one, financing the dynasty's enemies. Richelieu formed an alliance with Sweden and undertook to pay 1,000,000 livres annually. King Gustaf Adolf of Sweden agreed to maintain 30,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry units in Germany. The alliance enabled the Swedish forces to stay in position at Austria's borders, ready to deliver a severe blow and hold the Austrian army back.
Here is a dispatch from your commander:
"Monsieur,
The enemies of France are stronger than ever before and may engage us at any moment. We are therefore leading major forces to the border. Your corps is to advance towards the border and patrol your assigned sector. Also, you should follow any personal instructions which you may receive from his Eminence Cardinal Richelieu. An emissary will pass by your position. He is a high-ranking official authorized to negotiate with our Swedish allies. The emissary will be carrying a large amount of money, so you should rendezvous with the transport and escort it to the King of Sweden."
