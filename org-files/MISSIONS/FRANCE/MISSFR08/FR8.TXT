1648
France and its allies scored new triumphs in the war for four years. In March 1648, the French army crossed the Rhine and met the Swedes in Fracony. The combined forces ferried over the Main river and progressed to Bohemia. The Imperial Bavarian army retreated to the Danube without showing resistance and regrouped in a well-fortified camp at Zusmarshausen. It was time to deliver the decisive blow which, if successful, could result in the capitulation of Austria and its allies.
