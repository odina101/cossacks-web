1637
The Imperial Army had been fighting the French for several months. Under pressure from the Imperial forces, the French army retreated to Metz, where bloody battles ensued. The King and the Cardinal received the bad news that Austria had gained a new ally: Spain and its army, which was already heading for the French border.
The war brought destruction and misery, devastating the territories where military operations took place. It was obvious to the French commanders that, in order to achieve a turning point, they would have to establish bases, recover captured French regions and shift the centre of operations to enemy territory. The French forces often demonstrated true heroism. French Colonel Turenne and his small squad managed to capture the well-defended fortress of Lamot, which was guarded by numerically superior Imperial forces. For this brilliant operation, Turenne was awarded the rank of major-general.
You have received a new directive from you commander:
"Colonel,
Your regiment is assigned to the territory which has just been retaken. The front line is nearby, so your situation will be delicate. Your primary objective is to repel any enemy units that venture into your territory. I must tell you that most towns and villages of the region have been razed to the ground and lie in ruins, therefore you must rebuild a small settlement to support your army and train your recruits. And don't forget to build fortifications and organize reconnaissance, for the enemy may attack at any time."
