Serving the Cardinal

In 1618, tension between Catholics and Protestants has reached the top, and Europe broke out with a war later called the Thirty Years' War. France of that time was a feudal state with an army that could not fight back foreign menaces, thus a war threatened with conquest and devastation.
After joining the French Army in the rank of an officer, you will take part in grandiose events that will entail formation of the National army and establishment of a centralized French state. Within 20 years France will endure bloody wars for repartition of Europe and become one of the most powerful and influential states of the Old World.
