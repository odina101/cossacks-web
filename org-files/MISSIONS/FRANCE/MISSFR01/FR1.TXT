1630
The Thirty Years' War has been raging in Europe for 12 years. Aware that the French army is inferior to the enemy, Cardinal Richelieu is trying to reform it and create regular forces with guns and artillery. The Cardinal also hopes to reform the administration system. He is opposed by many feudal lords, who refuse to invest large sums and give up their privileges. Many have risen up against Richelieu. He faces the necessity of strengthening the royal power and transforming the feudal state into a centralized one. Epidemics and famine have befallen France and aggravated its condition. You receive your long-awaited officer's commission. Attached to it is a letter from the Colonel General:
"Monsieur,
It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you upon joining the glorious French army, but for the moment it is a basin into which we throw the sewage and scum of society. Picardian and Piedmontese "bandits" are the heart of our infantry. The big brass harbours Huguenots. I cling to the hope that Cardinal Richelieu's military reforms will yield the desired improvement. You are ordered to go to Lorraine to found a military base and train a company of pikemen. The war is a long way away from France at present, so the menace are mainly gangs of retired mercenaries vagabonding in the country in search of loot.
May God be with you, Monsieur."
