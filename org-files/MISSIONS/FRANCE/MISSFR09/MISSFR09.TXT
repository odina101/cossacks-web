  A squad of new musketeers is under your command. To the east of here lies an estate belonging to the Marquis de Louvoir, who is loyal to the King. The Marquis is aware of your visit, and with his help you will be able to assemble an efficient army.

  You meet three musketeers: "Ha! Look at that! The King's faithful slave is leading swine into battle against true noblemen. Hey, monsieur! Why the hurry? You'll die right here!"
#PAGE3 Missions\Pictures\faces 3
  You knock at the gate of the de Louvoir estate. A frightened door-keeper opens the gate: "We are under attack! The enemies are pressing hard from the east! The Marquis has been waiting for you, he will be here soon."

  Greetings, milord! I am the Marquis de Louvoir, a faithful myrmidon of His Majesty. Those damned traitors have been encroaching upon my domain. Du Vernes, my neighbour to the east, has made a deal with foreigners and is now recruiting hordes of mercenaries.
#PAGE4A Missions\Pictures\faces 27
  I know you need my assistance, but for now I am unable to give it. I must protect my land. If only we could destroy du Vernes's diplomatic centre ... But without artillery, it is impossible.
#PAGE4B Missions\Pictures\faces 27
  My scouts have reported that mutineers are concealing a howitzer in the forest to the north of here. If you could capture it and demolish the diplomatic centre, it would be a great help. Return here when you are done, and I will help you. I give you my word as a nobleman!

#PAGE8A Missions\Pictures\faces 27
  You again? Oh yes, I gave you my word ... Very well, take my soldiers, my barracks, my stable and my blacksmith. You can keep them until the mutineers have been defeated!
#PAGE8B Missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 15
  You will need an artillery depot to besiege the strongholds of rebellious noblemen. The best way is to capture a depot from d'Engoulemme. His estate is to the north-east of the demolished diplomatic centre.
