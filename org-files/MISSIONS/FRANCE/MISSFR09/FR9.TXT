1650
After the exhausting war against Austria and its allies, France faced a new ordeal. Tension between the French nobles and the King finally came to the surface after twenty years of smouldering. The nobility objected to Richelieu's economic and social reforms, repudiated the supreme power of the King and regarded him as equal among equals. Some noblemen even refused public service and hatched plots against the government. Malcontent nobles assembled their troops and stirred up a rebellion later called known as the Fronde. Forces loyal to the King advanced to suppress the riot.
You have received the King's directive:
"Colonel,
You are one of our most experienced commanders. Many times you have put your own life in jeopardy for the sake of France and proved your loyalty to your King. We are assigning you to lead our faithful troops and to eradicate the bad-temper nobles. Proceed to the south of France and squelch these presumptuous scoundrels who are a disgrace to their noble title.
King Louis XIV"
