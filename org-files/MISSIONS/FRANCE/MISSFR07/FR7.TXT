This year, the Spanish army (comprising 20,000 infantry units, 8,000 cavalry units and 30 cannons) under the command of Melas has won several battles, approached the northern borders of France and besieged the fortress of Rocroi. The French forces (16,000 infantry units, 7,000 cavalry units, 12 cannons) led by Prince Condes are advancing towards the fortress to assist the garrison. This battle is of great importance: If the French can cope with the Spanish army, the war will rapidly approach its turning point. Your squad will join the vanguard. Here is a dispatch from your commander:
"Colonel,
I make no secret of the fact that this battle at Rocroi is vital for France. Your forces are inferior to the Spanish. In this event, our success will be a result of precise planning - and probably of fortune, too. For the time being, our headquarters need more information on the enemy. I order you to reconnoitre enemy positions and cause damage to their supply lines if possible."
