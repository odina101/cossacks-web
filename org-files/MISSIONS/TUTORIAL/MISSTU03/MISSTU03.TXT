  Frigates and Xebecs
#P4_1 missions\Pictures\england 2
  Frigates and xebecs constitute the main combat force of your navy. They are moderately dear and possess a good rate of fire. These vessels are best used in combination with galleys. Galleys will take the main blow from the enemy, while frigates and xebecs shell the enemy at long range.
#P5 NONE
  Battleships
#P5_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 4

#P8 NONE
  How do I effectively combine different vessels?
#P8_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 7

#P9 NONE
  What is required to drive an enemy from shipping routes?
#P9_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 8
  Cannons upgraded for accuracy and range of fire can fight an enemy back from your shore for a while. After that, using your artillery cover, you will be able to start building shipyards and vessels.
#P10 NONE
  How do I defend my coast using towers?
#P10_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 9
  Towers can be used to protect the coast against yachts only. Other vessels have a larger range of fire than towers.
#P11 NONE
  How do I upgrade towers?
#P11_1 missions\Pictures\mord_tut 12
  Once you have built an artillery depot, each tower interface will show you a fire rate upgrade icon. When being upgraded, the tower may be captured like any other civilian building.
#P12 NONE
  What is the upgrade of walls' and towers' durability for?
#P12_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 11

#P13 NONE
  What is the upgrade of buildings' durability for?
#P13_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 12
  Two durability upgrades for buildings make structures with a high life parameter virtually invulnerable.
#P14 NONE
  How do I carry out sallies effectively?
#P14_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 14
  Undefended enemy peasants, mines, civil and uncompleted military buildings may be captured even by a single military unit. The best option is to use two or three mounted units in a sally.
#P15 NONE
  What do I do first of all when trying to destroy enemy buildings?
#P15_1 missions\Pictures\mord_tut 18
  Look for the buildings of primary importance with the lowest life parameters.
#P16 NONE
  Why is it impossible to create artillery in a captured enemy artillery depot?
#P16_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 15
  You need to have a blacksmith and a stable of the same nation as the captured artillery depot to create artillery there.
#P17 NONE
  How do I use captured enemy peasants?
#P17_1 missions\Pictures\mord3_tut 16
  Since there may be 100 people in a town hall and 170 to 150 in a barracks, build a town hall and a barracks of the enemy nation as lodgings for your people.
