#P12 NONE
  How do I make my cannon fire cannonballs or grapeshot?
#P12_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 11
  A cannon can fire cannonballs or grapeshot. Grapeshot should be used when an enemy is close to your line, because that is when grapeshot is more effective than cannonballs. To fire cannonballs, indicate a target for the cannon. Grapeshot will be fired automatically.
#P13 NONE
  What obstacles will prevent units from firing?
#P13_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 12
  The following obstacles may hinder your units: uneven terrain (hills, rocks, etc), buildings or stone walls. If an obstacle blocks a unit's line of fire, it will be unable to shoot. Paling is not an obstacle for units' fire.
#P14 NONE
  How do I capture enemy buildings, artillery and peasants?
#P14_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 13
  Artillery, peasants and most buildings can be captured. To do this, you need to move an infantry or cavalry unit towards the target. If there is no enemy guard in the neighbourhood, the target will be yours (take on your colour) at once. A guard is any enemy infantry or mounted unit near the object you are planning to capture.
#P15 NONE
  How do I protect my buildings, artillery and peasants from being captured?
#P15_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 14
  To guard your city from raids, you need to locate military units near each building, mine, building under construction, artillery unit or peasant.
#P16 NONE

#P19 NONE
  How do I demolish enemy buildings?
#P19_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 18
  Any enemy building can be demolished by artillery, grenadiers or archers. Mortars are effective at long range, howitzers cause major damage. Cannon and vessels have medium attack power. Grenadiers are rather efficient, especially if their attack power has been upgraded. Archers and mercenaries are the most effective when numerous.
#P20 NONE
  How do I create 1 to 5 units at once?
#P20_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 19
  To order 1 unit, left-click on its icon in the barracks' interface. To order 5 units, hold down the "SHIFT" key while clicking.

  Why do I train my units?
#P22_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 21
  Many units have two upgrade icons in the barracks (below their creation icon). The upper icon refers to an upgrade that will increase their attack power, the lower is relevant to shield (defence) upgrades. A summary of the upgrades made will appear in the information window of the unit in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.
#P23 NONE
  Why do I conduct upgrades in my academy and blacksmith?
#P23_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 22

  A blacksmith offers upgrades relating to metalwork.
#P24 NONE
  Which upgrades are the most important?

  4. Fishing: "Design new tackle and fishing nets (boats' efficiency +100%)"
  5. Mounted units' creation time: "Forge harnesses for horses (increases mounted units' building speed 4 times)".

#P25 NONE
  What resources are needed to maintain my units?
#P25_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 24
  Food is needed to maintain all your units, therefore you will always be spending. The bigger your army, the more food should be produced. When you run out of food, a famine will begin and your units will starve to death one by one. Always make sure that you have at least 1,000 of food. To maintain mercenaries, you need gold. If you run out of gold, the mercenaries will revolt. During a famine, mercenary units will not die. Artillery and ships also require financing. If you have no gold, these units will not fight.
#P26 NONE
  What resources are needed to carry out a battle?
#P26_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 25
  Any shot requires iron and gunpowder (coal). A gunshot requires a small amount of resources (1 iron, 1 coal); a mortar shot uses up more (60 iron, 100 coal). If you run out of these resources, buy them at the market immediately, otherwise your units will not fire.
#P27 NONE
  How do I supervise my resources' balance?
#P27_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 26
  Make sure that your gold and food are constantly increased. Food should be kept at 1,000 to 5,000 to avoid sudden famines. The more iron and coal you have, the better. Since you always spend stone to repair stone walls, make sure that your stocks are sufficient.
#P28 NONE
  What do I do if I have spent too many resources?
#P28_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 27
  If you realize that food is being consumed too fast, immediately gather all your peasants together and send them to your fields. If that does not help, dismiss part of your army (select them and press "DEL"). Go on doing this until you your food supplies increase. If your gold is being spent too quickly, find out which military force is consuming it and dismiss (destroy) it. Much gold will be spent to maintain hundreds of mercenaries, dozens of cannons and battleships. If you have no gold, riots will begin on your battleships.
#P29 NONE
  How do I use a market?
#P29_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 28
  You can use a market to exchange your excess resources (left column) for ones you require (right column) by specifying the quantity you want to barter. Prices for resources will change according to market laws when you sell or buy resources.
#P30 NONE
  Why do the construction costs for some structures change?
#P30_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 29
  Many buildings become more expensive depending on the number of them you have. Thus, each new tower will cost 20% more than the previous one. Some units (e.g. cannons) also become more expensive.
#P31 NONE
  When can I build the 18th century barracks?
#P31_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 30
  At the beginning of the game, you can see the semi-transparent button "Progress to the 18th Century" in your town hall interface. It will become active when a market, a church and an artillery depot have been built. After progressing to the 18th century, it will be possible to build an 18th century barracks. Additionally, the academy will allow you to study new sciences (e.g. a Montgolfier balloon that reveals the whole map to you).
#P32 NONE
  How do I make my units embark and disembark from a ferry?
#P32_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 31
  To make units embark, move a ferry towards the shore (select the ferry and click on the landing point). When the ferry approaches the shore, select it. You should see a flashing X marking the point of embarkation. If there is no X, try to moor the ferry to the shore again. Send your units onto the ferry. Once they are aboard, specify the location where you want to transport the units. When the vessel has pulled up at the specified location, click on the "Disembark All" icon in the ferry interface.
#P33 NONE

#P34 NONE
  How do I build a gate?
#P34_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 33

#P35 NONE
  How do I open and close gates?
#P35_1 Missions\Pictures\mord_tut 34

#P38 NONE
