# 🚀 Quick Start: HD Terrain Upgrade

## 1. Delete Old Assets
Delete the contents of `assets/terrain/grass/` (the small 64x32 tiles are too small).

## 2. Add New HD Assets
Add at least one large grass texture to `assets/terrain/grass/`:
- **Name:** `grass_base_1.png`
- **Size:** **256x128 pixels** (or larger)
- **Style:** Detailed green grass texture, isometric diamond shape

## 3. That's It!
The system will automatically detect the new assets. I will then update the renderer code to handle these larger tiles for a seamless, high-quality look.

**Ready when you are!** 🎨
